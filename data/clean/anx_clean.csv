I was offered yesterday the opportunity to do something quite unexpectedly. It was a situation where you have to take a bit of a risk. Every fiber in my body was telling me to say no. It felt as if my instincts were telling me to say no. I said yes anyway. I am so happy I did. Now I realize that was just anxiety,  it has been happening alot where anxiety is overriding my internal intuition and I don't want to go through life without being able to trust my gut feeling. It has made me miss some life changing opportunities. Any advice on how to tell the difference?"

My question is (and i hope this doesn't sound stupid) how likely is it for me to experience bad withdrawal symptoms? Im really scared of having a seizure or something bad happening to me. I dont see people ever say they have problems coming off of it when the dose is at that lowest point it always people who take like 2mg or more.

Reddit is the closest thing to a friend or therapy that I have, so I tend to vent-post a lot. And then I feel stupid for posting and delete. Rinse and repeat like, every week. I do it on this sub all the time, honestly.

I knew it was a problem I had for a while, but I just kinda ignore it. However, a mod on a sub that I vent-post a ton recently asked me why I do this. I honestly never thought that anyone would notice. Now it's made me want to examine why I keep repeating this behavior.

22,htraptor,Needs A Hug/Support,1,Anxiety,1606682070,"I feel like I'm losing it I'm so worried and stressed that it's affecting my health. I have constant migraines, I get lightheaded and occasionally nauseous, and it's hard to be happy for even small periods of time. 

I've been battling depression for about 7 years, but I've never felt an extreme amount of anxiety (or at least enough to say it's interfering with my life). The last few weeks, however, has been breaking me. 

There are things I'm anxious about that I shouldn't even be worried about. From family, school, relationships, the future, my image, and every single thing I feel that's negative or could somehow/sometime happen. It's constantly worrying me and it's draining me. 

It's affecting my relationship. My boyfriend and I recently moved in a few months ago and my anxiety has me paranoid. I know this man loves me, but small things make me wonder if he hates me or is using me. 

If my parents look at me a certain way, I wonder if they hate me too or if I've done something wrong. I then think of how much of a disappointment I am and how much trouble I've caused. 

Therapy hasn't been effective for my anxiety. I've been in therapy for many months for my depression and I've mentioned the flared anxiety. They only suggested ""small bandaids"". When I reiterated how much it was affecting me, I was still only told to focus on smaller tasks to deal with it. It doesn't even help. 

I feel like I'm losing it. Everything that's not even bad has me double-taking and worrying. Even things that worry me and can be resolved make me feel defeated and unable to overcome it. It's literally destroying me from the inside out and I feel like crying every day. 

What do I do? How do I fix my anxiety? Or even learn to live with it?"

I hate smells. They‚Äôre fucking obnoxious. In order to be happy i need everything entirely clean and aired out. The smell of food makes me gag.
It causes me genuine anger. Why can‚Äôt people fucking air their houses out.
Why does my family cook at weird random times? And why so much cooking?!?!?!

I‚Äôm fairly new to Reddit so forgive me if I format anything incorrectly. So the last few weeks I‚Äôve been getting really nauseous and have been feeling absolutely horrible. One day I will feel totally fine then the next it just hits me with this awful nausea. I‚Äôve always had anxiety my whole life as my dad has it much worse than me and a few other family members have it as well. Usually it‚Äôs been good and under control but the last few months it‚Äôs become way worse. 

My sleep schedule has always been not too great either so I‚Äôm thinking that may be a big contributing factor. Honestly it just makes me feel so weak and embarrassed about it ya know? It‚Äôs like this constant worry and stress that never goes away. The anxiety also tends to turn into depression as well and it makes me have darker thoughts like killing myself just so it will all go away. I feel like I can‚Äôt even do the things I enjoy anymore because of this anxious sickness I‚Äôve been experiencing. 

It‚Äôs been messing up my digestion and just throwing my whole body out of wack. My girlfriend has been very supportive and says that when I get distracted it tends to go away. Which makes me feel better as hopefully that could mean my anxiety isn‚Äôt as bad. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore guys. Like I just feel so sick and I‚Äôve always been pretty healthy my family doesn‚Äôt really have any bad health attributes. Lately I‚Äôve just been more depressed each day because I just can‚Äôt imagine living my life feeling like this."

On Zoloft and therapy now which I find is helping but still a way off from being back to myself 24/7. 

One thing I noticed was a tight chest ruining my sleeping habits, and then I noticed that I had started back vaping a few weeks before my anxiety hit a peak. 

Stopped vaping altogether earlier this week and started getting some real testing anxiety moments again.

Could I really have gotten this addicted to nicotine in the space of a month to the point where it put me on full anxiety mode?  I do wildly overuse the vape when I have it, and most of my worst moments are when I‚Äôm out somewhere and not using it. 

I have always smoked the odd cigarette but no doubt am massively increasing my nicotine intake by smoking a vape all day."
28,Flabberjackets,Relationship,4,Anxiety,1606681282,"Getting Mixed Signals as to Whether Someone Wants to Be My Friend. My Anxiety Can‚Äôt Handle it Anymore. So me (M20) and this girl (F18) met up and hung out as friends around late September. It was fun and she texted back after saying she had a good time. I asked her to hangout a few more times during October and she was busy. I was getting the vibe that maybe she didn't wanna be my friend or was truly busy. I tend to overthink things so idk.

Last week she texted me for plans which surprised me. She said ""hey! do you ever wanna go to barnes and nobles and look for manga sometime? I‚Äôve actually never been in that section before and I‚Äôve always wanted to look around"" Its something we talked about so ik the text was meant for me. I responded saying ""Yah for sure! Im busy Saturday but totally free Sunday."" I never get a response so Sunday I text her again saying ""Hey! Are you free anytime this week? lmk."" No response. Yesterday she posts a snapchat of her at the store so I guess she ended up going without me.

Its been a week and she hasn't texted. I seriously don't know what I should say to her now. I hate being the clingy person that texts three times in a row. I think she wants to be friends since she's the one that texted me for plans but kinda confused why she went without me and never responded. Definitely not annoyed by me since she texts me for convo sometimes.

One of my girl friends from back home said maybe she thinks I'm pursuing her romantically and that she's shy to meet-up again or doesn't wanna let me down. I definitely get vibes that she's shy or introverted because she talked about how her only friends are online. If thats the case how do I tell her I just wanna hang as friends without being a jerk? I wouldn't be opposed to dating in the future but for now I really just want at least one friend I can hit up for plans at my University. Ive never been more confused by a someone in my entire life.

This is my very first time producing a film, but I have a great team behind me who are also passionate about this topic. The film is called Good Girls, and it's an educational short film that will be used to help educate about mental awareness &amp; anxiety disorders, inspire individuals experiencing symptoms to seek help, and to share about the process one might take and treatment options for alleviating the struggles of anxiety.

Currently, we have our crew, locations, and we are casting, but our major goal is to build a community around the film. We were wondering if you would be interested in joining our facebook group which is used to support each other and provide resources.

33,tandristyn,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1606679748,"Dog caught ticks- major anxiety from the thought of these pests Recently my family visited my brother's home with our dog and unfortunately came across ticks. My dog wears a small shirt and we saw one (a nymph) crawling on her shirt. We took it off and checked her but didn't find anything. I am someone with very extreme anxiety about ticks. I have bad anxiety in general but ticks are something that scare me so bad. 

Fast forward to last night when I was in my brother's home and found another nymph crawling along my blanket. Immediately I was freaking out. I felt like they were just all over me at that point. We left early to come home from our trip because of it and I got a shower immediately. I checked my body for anything and didn't find anything, but am still worried about something being in my hair. 

We bathed our dog and unfortunately found two ticks on her. Another nymph and one that sort of looked like it had been feeding for a bit, both at the same entrypoint. I stepped up and was the one to remove them, but have been feeling sick and lightheaded since this whole thing started and it's taken a lot out of me to calm myself down to the point where I don't faint. I've felt like I was on the verge of it for a couple times now.

Here is where I need the advice. I am freaking out thinking they're on me now. On our things. On my dog even more than what we found. Are they going to fall off and attach on us in the home?  Are they going to lay eggs inside our house and cause an infestation? Can they crawl from my dog and go on us instead??

These questions have been running through my mind all night long. It may seem like such an overreaction but they are something that have really scared me for most of my life. I havent been able to get any sleep and I'm scratching my body so much that I've begun to practically give myself marks from how hard I'm just panicing and itching THINKING that somethings on me. I also had lice as a kid and that's traumatized me to these small pests that I'm just freaking out.

I've cross posted this on thr r/DogAdvice subreddit to get more help for my dog on her side, but here I think I need more help for myself. I haven't been able to calm myself down since this happened and know ticks aren't a big deal to hunters and more woodsy people, but I haven't really had much experience with this and already have a massive phobia about bugs. Every black speck, every hair brushing against me, every little think I used when I was visiting my brothers house I'm having trouble using again thinking there's something on there. I need some kind of help because I cannot live like this

Tl;dr: dog caught ticks, major anxiety causing panic, how to help calm my mind about these pests"

I don't know what it is, my doctors don't know. I've got a literal fucking spreadsheet where I track the ingredients of everything I eat, etc. etc.

Anyway, I had another episode on Saturday and the stress of dealing with it (even though there's nothing I can do) has meant that absolutely nothing has happened all weekend. I've just been in bed, essentially for 48 hours, taking pictures of the reaction to send to my doctor and stressing myself to hell and back thinking about what could be causing it and if I'm going to have another episode (antihistamines have not been helpful and the reaction seems to be getting progressively worse).

I just don't know what to do. I'm doing everything I can on the allergy front, but the anxiety front is making sure that literally nothing else gets done.

Its not severe i haven't had any real pain for like 3 weeks but for the beginning 2 weeks i convinced myself of anything from cervical radiculopathy to bone growths in spine to spine misalignment to myofascial pain syndrome to thoracic outlet. (I visited a gp and a spine orthopedist and both said my neck rotation is fine, gp told me he thought it was cervical radiculopathy but on a followup sent me to pt saying possibly muscle strain)

I did have a weird flare up where on week 2 i panicked so hard my entire arm tensed up soooo tight and the veins popped to the surface and the tension went all the way from my right face to my palm of the right hand, i was so spaced out and i was talking very slow and monotone just saying i didnt want to live in this hell. (after a walk it completley went away, since i had veins popping in both hands the gp and pt chalked it up to anxiety since there was no purple or tingling in the hand and my heartrate was through the roof)

I have a pt whos helped mobilize my body and thats helped alot but so far the last thing to go is the tension starting behind my jaw under my ear down to the pit of my clavicle or i guess my scalenes, the tension shifts from the clavicle to my jaw and cheek to behind my head and it drives me up a wall with fear that it will be here forever, i dry heave when i start really panicking. Im on lorazepam and celexa and they help a bit but im so scared this minor pulling in my neck and jaw will never go away and im looking everywhere for help but also just need to vent because nothing has happened to me in my life like this and its terrible for my already obsessive anxiety."

I cleaned my bedroom for 10 minutes in the dark last night after a jag of random manic inspiration. Then I thought, ""I don't need to stress about it for a month"". In the daylight, I can see that I didn't really get a lot done. I'm stuck this way.

I feel like I tidied my slightly messy bedroom to avoid the actual problem; the rest of my house. There's broken glass *everywhere*, clothes, hundreds of pieces of unopened probably-important mail, empty wine bottle graveyard, trash. I just get so fucking stressed out and panic. Is anyone else dealing with this?

Recently there was a bat stuck in my house for 2 weeks. I was screaming my head off and tossing random things at it, to try and get it to fly away. My living room floor is still littered with all the things I threw at it."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting home alone and I'm freaking out and just need to vent or have somebody tell me its going to be okay because I'm scared I might do something stupid. 

I work for a company that provides support to people with learning disabilities. I support one guy in particular at a day centre, and this day centre has put in a complaint about ""concerns regarding my quality of support"". They claim that I don't engage with this autistic guy enough and leave him on a computer/without activities throughout the day. The thing is... that's in the guys support plan! That's what he needs. This isn't the thing that has upset me though.

My work knows I have OCD, Depression and anxiety. I was open from the moment I got the job and told them about my meds etc. I had a miscarriage in October last year and haven't dealt with it very well so my meds were upped. I explained this to the dept manager last week in supervision and explained that I wasn't dealing well. Then a friend of mine died and I wasn't able to go to the funeral because of the whole COVID bullshit so it's been an utterly shit week. Then all this happened on Thursday and they informed that a complaint had been made but they needed to investigate and would get back to me Friday. They didn't call me so I ended up chasing it up myself and they said they had to speak with HR and get back to me - which of course made me more anxious. They said we would have a meeting Monday to discuss what was found but again, its Sunday night and nobody has been in touch so I have no idea what is happening, no idea what is being said about me or if I'm in big trouble. 

I've had issues with bad employers before which my managers know about too. I have had constant panic attacks since Thursday and can't sleep. I love the guy I support and make sure that he has the best possible care - and yes, sometimes I misspeak or fuck up but I try my fucking hardest and its just so painful to have people who I thought had no issue with me (the centre are lovely to my face, I help them out a lot and even went on collection runs in my car to get DVDS and books for them even though its nothing to do with me. I spent my own money on things they needed) so its really hurtful to know they've talked shit about me. 

I don't even know why I've turned to this forum, but I have no friends really, and I cant tell my mam that I fucked up again as I'm already the loser of the family. I think I just need a hug."

What do you go through, how does anxiety affect you physically and mentally, what kind of thought do you have, what feelings do you have?
Are some days better than others? are some days full of off and on anxiety? somedays does it prevent you from hanging out with people, going to the store... or doing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things? 

Sometimes I can understand my anxiety and how it affects me and other times i‚Äôm completely lost. For example, I wonder if what I think and feel is even normal for someone with anxiety... or does it effect us all slightly differently. For example, tightness in chest, heavy breathing, shaking. Another example, sad/harmful thoughts and other feelings such as worthlessness.

People can‚Äôt usually see us the affects of anxiety unless they are family/close friends/a boyfriend or spouse... and even if they see us go though it sometimes it feels there is no real understanding of the extent we go through(maybe this is just for me but if it goes for you all lmk)
It‚Äôs just really difficult when I feel people in my daily life can‚Äôt understand how it truly affects me. I get pushed to limits by family, friends, and boyfriends.

I‚Äôm feeling very anxious and strange right now. I think I know why, I‚Äôm absolutely exhausted. I‚Äôve been battling anxiety for the past 10 or so years just for background. 

My dog had a litter of puppies Friday night, we (my partner and I) thought she was going in to labour on Thursday night, so we didn‚Äôt sleep very well Thursday. 
Then all Friday morning I was really anxious, I was worried about my dog and whether she‚Äôd be okay, and whether the pups would all be okay. 

She finished giving birth around 11pm on Friday, with minor complications during the birth and a scare at one point when she started bleeding quite a bit after I had to pull a puppy out of her that was stuck. I‚Äôm happy to say that she‚Äôs well now and has settled in to being a mum nicely! 

On Friday I got to bed about 4am, after letting my partner get some sleep, and then was up after about 2 hours - we can‚Äôt let the dog or pups out of our sight at the moment as she may sit on one etc and we need to be there to chaperone.

Saturday I wasn‚Äôt too bad, was exhausted, emotionally and physically, but I managed to get a cat nap in at lunch time and my partner and I took it in turns watching her all night, getting little 2 hour sleeps in each and then swapping. 

Today I just feel awful. I feel so exhausted, the most tired I have ever felt in my life, and when I‚Äôm tired it usually makes my anxiety a lot worse, or at least it‚Äôs a lot harder to reassure myself that I‚Äôll be okay. The exhaustion is really hard for me, I feel so strange, physically and mentally. The past 3 days have blurred in to one and I‚Äôm starting to struggle. 

Sorry to rant - I feel like I just need some reassurance that things will get easier soon and that I will be able to cope, I really don‚Äôt want to let my partner down and I really want to start feeling more in control. I can deal with the anxiety usually, it just feels hopeless today, like there‚Äôs no escape from it and like everything‚Äôs not going to be okay. 

TL;DR - dog had puppies Friday night and haven‚Äôt slept very much in the past 3 days, or the sleep has been very disturbed, and it‚Äôs making me feel like my anxiety has got the better of me. Would love some reassurance or tips from anyone who has dealt with this"

This happened yesterday and I get this dizziness and pressure in my ears while feeling severe paranoia. I usually soothe myself by rubbing my forearms, pacing and even rocking my body back in forth (similar to self stimulation for autistic individuals).

I also when I get really mad and dizzy sometimes just want to bang my head on something, just to get out of my own thoughts. I don't usually do this because I know it's irrational but I have known to punch walls and hit my own head against things or punch my own head/face in the past. I almost feel like I want to yell for help but that's such a low thing to do but doing these things for attention but I don't know.

These episodes have been happening a lot more often during covid since I am alone sometimes for the whole day. Last time I had some weed to calm down and that really helped but I don't know if it's a good idea to abuse it like that. 

Like I said, I know I need to see someone. My insurance changed on Jan 1st and I get alot better options then so I have been pushing things off but this has been affecting my relationships because I've been being a real dick the past few days with snide comments and such but I feel such a malaise and I'm so irritated with everything.

 I made oral sex to one of them and I fingered both of them, I bite my nails maybe this put me in risk, but doctors told me is very very low risk.

But 17 days after those encounters I felt feverish (99.4 F Armpit Temperature), i had fatigue (I stayed in bed for a few hours), i had a headache (strong) and muscle pain, but these symptoms lasted 1 day and a half, maybe two days max. Now i feel good and i don‚Äôt have any symptoms! Yesterday I noticed a little bump on my armpit, maybe it a swollen node i don‚Äôt know. Oh! It was not COVID what happened because I tested negative.

&amp;#x200B;

I called an HIV/STD organization in my city and I explained my case to them and they told me to be calm, that there is nothing to worry about! But I don‚Äôt usually get sick so I don‚Äôt know.

&amp;#x200B;

NEXT Tuesday on *December 1* (**World AIDS/HIV Day**, what a coincidence, right?), I have an appointment for a HIV *4th Generation* Exam at the hospital in city in Madrid (Europe). I waited this long so I have a good window period. I will receive the results after 5-6 days, so i will have to wait.

I always try to be there for him, I know the pain of having a lot on your plate and not a lot of people to turn to. However... He doesn't talk a lot about how he feels. When he's overwhelmed, he chooses to lay in bed for a time, fully covered and asks me to leave him be. In fact, he's currently in bed as I type this, not feeling like doing anything at all. 

I am used to having people directly speak up when they have problems (me included), but he's always been withdrawn, I never understood why. 

I am an anxiety sufferer myself, and the situation does trigger it to a degree. It's a fear I've always had that stems from an abusive mother being in bed for days, all window blinds closed, dark house and being left to fend for myself as a child. She'd do this every time something displeased her, no matter how minimum the issue. So... when my husband retreats, all the old triggers surface. I fear he will not get out of bed during the whole weekend, we won't get to do anything, talk, eat, discuss... I fear the problem being permanent, even though it's probably irrational.

I have panic disorder, social anxiety,
depression, and more so i'm basically used to panic attacks and such.. But this was a new feeling i've never felt before.
When i woke up it felt like my brain was being cut in half in a way, it was not painful or anything, completely in my head, I couldn't go back to asleep because it was like my head was fighting with itself. 
After 40 minutes of this weird feeling i finally broke down into a full panicked state and started crying. I felt as if i was actually going clinically insane and that any second i was going to lose my sence of reality..
After like an hour of this I talked myself out of it and didn't end up going back to sleep until 7am because i was scared the feeling would come back if i went back to sleep.
This is all i can remember from that night, there are many other details but my mind blocked them out since it became traumatic and some i can't seem to figure out how to put into words.
Anyways it happened again tonight. I went to sleep at around 1am and woke up at 2:30am in this weird brain cutting state. Again i couldn't go back to sleep and i don't know why but my brain kept telling me to be scared. This time i was very angry too. As soon as i opened my eyes i could feel the anger boiling in my head, this reason for that anger seems to come from the fact that i don't know why im feeling this feeling. 
Luckily i was able to calm it down much quicker by eating some food and watching youtube to distract myself but it really bothers me that i don't know what this feeling is.
I havent been on any anxiety or depression medicine since March and nothing is happening before i go to sleep to cause this... 
i posted it here in the anxiety group because i don't know where else to go. 
we don't have insurance right now so i can't go to any doctors or therapists...

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

To make a long story short, I made a plan to kill myself about a week ago. I‚Äôm a college student right now, I‚Äôm living by myself and away from my family for the first time in my life. My grades are dropping by the week, and I can‚Äôt focus on anything because I‚Äôm so fucking stressed all the time. I‚Äôm stressed because I have bad grades and if I can‚Äôt pass any of my classes this semester I‚Äôll lose my scholarship. I won‚Äôt be able to return and finish my degree. 

I don‚Äôt want to spend my life working in the restaurant or retail industry, I‚Äôve done that for too long and honestly working there makes me sad. I see all my coworkers barely scraping by in their studio apartments, 30, 40, 50 years old working two or three jobs just to barely get by. I just want to live in a nice apartment without working multiple jobs and without working weekends, is that too much to ask? In short, if I fail any of my classes this semester I won‚Äôt be able to afford to continue my degree program. I won‚Äôt be able to work any jobs offering a living wage that doesn‚Äôt involve having my soul sucked out of me. In short, it‚Äôs now or never and I have failed. 

My family are my biggest supporters, and I‚Äôm letting them all down. I‚Äôm afraid to tell them I‚Äôm feeling like this, they think I‚Äôm doing just fine. My mom in particular worries about me all the time because she‚Äôs the one I talked to when I told her everything that happened to me before I was diagnosed in 2016.

122,Such_Web8074, ,1,Anxiety,1603522378,"Apparently I get panic attacks now. 30yo m To start off I have pretty major heart problems I was born with a whole in my heart and my heart was backwards. they had to do an arterial switch and I had something called transposition of the great vessels and fix the hole. I have a pacemaker and I have gone through 8 open heart surgeries and 5 heart caths throughout my life surgeries were to replace arteries and caths for stents. I keep pretty healthy I walk/jog at least 5 miles a day and do body weight training 3 times a week. (cant wait for covid to end to get back into the gym and lift some weights.) I don't do any drugs, I don't drink, and I don't even drink caffeine. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I saw my cardiologist he said everything looked great and he wanted to see me in a year to do a stress test were i run on a treadmill and they monitor my heart and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I have lived with this all my life so its normal for me I have never been worried about my health. I am actually happy I am alive every day thanks to medical technology.

&amp;#x200B;

The weird thing 2 weeks ago I had what I thought was a heart attack, my blood pressure went up to 150/100 normally its at 115/75, I felt dizzy, I was sweating, I couldn't breathe, I could barely talk, my heart was racing, and everything was dialed up to 11. I felt like i just sprinted i could not calm down. So as calmly as i could i told my wife er now. and we went. 

&amp;#x200B;

got in there and they said everything was fine. they did blood work and ekg's and did a pacemaker interrogation. The literately said your fine your just having a panic attack. weird thing was I was not worried about anything. when this happened I was working since i work from home and I have nothing that i am worried about no family/financial troubles. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had panic attacks before and I have never just worried about my health.

&amp;#x200B;

so I go to my heart doctor the next day and said it was normal for people who have gone through what I have gone through have ""fizzures"" basically the heart goes into overdrive and the pacemaker didn't calm it down. they messed with stuff on the pacemaker and put a holter monitor on me and said I am most likely ok and panic attacks can have the same symptoms. 

&amp;#x200B;

so know I am waiting for the results of the holter monitor and every few days I guess I get mini panic attacks now. It was nothing like the first one but I can feel my blood pressure go up when it happens. If I start to feel weird it take my bp and it goes up to 140/80-155/90 range. I feel like its hard to take deep breaths and my heart races for a few minutes. Its super annoying and I have no idea why I am getting these panic attacks. They happen randomly when I am working/watching tv/gaming. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also many times a day I can feel my heart beat harder unless I sit up completely straight then it gets better. also when I am exercising is really the only time I feel super calm witch is weird. Like if I start to feel a episode come on I will start jogging in place and I start to feel better but then later on during the day when I am doing nothing the feeling may or may not come back. 

&amp;#x200B;

so point of all this is just wondering if anyone else here has a similar story. I will find out in a couple weeks if there is anything wrong with the heart but doctors are 98% sure its panic attacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

also anyone have any way to just ignore panic attacks I want to go back to were i don't have to worry any second my body will just decide to have an episode. thanks for reading have a great day"

126,vanilla_oatmilk,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1603520865,"Thoughts are just stories we tell ourselves. We tell stories to ourselves of our future, our past, and the situations we are in now (our ""perspective""). These stories can be emotional, and sway our beliefs. Humans are inherently story tellers. We have used stories since millenia to explain phenomena around us.

The problem is when we begin taking the story too seriously. It is taken out of context.

The key is observation. We must tease apart our beliefs from our thoughts. If you can think of every reason somebody might hate you, you can also think of a flying pig. Our imaginations are powerful, and to put it lightly, 99% of our thoughts are bullsh*t.

Anxiety is our amygdala in overdrive (the part of our brain that feels powerful emotions like stress &amp; anxiety). It is here to protect us, to love us, and comes from a place of holding our interest. When we label anxiety as ""bad"" or a ""disease"", we perceive it as such. We begin to fear anxiety.

Picture this: your anxiety is like a monkey. The monkey is quite adorable, but kind of irrational &amp; jumps to conclusions. It throws fits a lot, demanding your attention. The ruckus it causes is stressful, and sometimes we fear it or become angry or resentful toward it. Now imagine holding that monkey and calmly explaining the facts to it. Slowly it understands, and calms down. You give it a hug and thank it for its concern, and let it go. Sometimes calming that monkey down takes a lot of effort and convincing... but it can be done.

""Why did the monkey act out in the first place?"" You might ask. Sometimes it's relevant to identify the monkey's triggers, sometimes we need help identifying them, and sometimes it's just a brat and that's that. Over-analyzing will just stir the monkey again, and you'll be in an endless loop. Embracing uncertainty (ie. ""I don't know and that's okay"") is extremely beneficial.

Tldr; hug your monkey and tell it that it's full of sh*t."

Has anyone else experienced relief for anxiety from sex, I‚Äôve heard from others that it actually increases their anxiety so perhaps that‚Äôs a possibility too?"
144,sashimi6,Venting,1,Anxiety,1603512292,"I want to lay my mind to rest and mend the broken record spinning there. (This is a vent/stream of consciousness piece, because I‚Äôm trying to see if writing is going to be as cathartic for me as it once was. I hope at least one person can find comfort in knowing that you aren‚Äôt alone in feeling these things, if you do end up relating to any of them.)

I want to lay my mind to rest and mend the broken record spinning there. I miss my high school years when I‚Äôd ride on the adrenaline and never ruminate on where it would take me. I guess I didn‚Äôt realize that I would stop being brave. I don‚Äôt know when thrilled became terrified, where the boundless horizon of beautiful potential futures became a canvas for all the things that could possibly go wrong.

I‚Äôm tired of shifting and turning and sinking in bed for hours at night, sifting through conversations and wondering if my words were incidentally strung in a way I never meant for them to be. I am sick of yearning for friendship while hiding the most intimate parts of myself, because I am quite deplorable and a fraud and I still don‚Äôt know what I am underneath all the polished veneer. This is why I liked meeting new people when I traveled. It was easier to make them remember me as a character who was always light‚Äîwho never brought baggage to the conversation‚Äîwhen I knew I‚Äôd never see them again.

I apologize for the littlest, most inconsequential things and don‚Äôt quite know how to say sorry when it matters. I shake terribly when I‚Äôm asked to do tasks I haven‚Äôt rehearsed thrice in the comfort of my home. I worry so much about the consequences of my actions today and tomorrow and the next tomorrow and I can‚Äôt break the misfiring circuit in my head. I let my mistakes haunt me and I so badly want to grow from them but I am afraid of fucking up more times in ways I hadn‚Äôt daydreamed about before.

For a couple of months during my second year in medical school, I subconsciously channeled my anxiety into a different game: I couldn‚Äôt control how well I performed in tests no matter how hard I studied, but apartment fires I could prevent. I touched the stove knobs to make sure I didn‚Äôt imagine myself turning the stove off just a couple of minutes before. I ran my fingers over electrical sockets to know that I took out all the plugs. Maybe if I could feel the shapes of my fears I‚Äôd be able to let them go. Or maybe they‚Äôll hold onto me longer that with time I won‚Äôt even notice they‚Äôre there.

Sometimes I anchor myself to the fleeting moments when people told me that I seemed ‚Äúchill‚Äù, that I appeared confident and that I had my shit together. I told them all that‚Äôs a lie and that they should expect to be disappointed sooner or later. But I want to believe them when they say I am better than I see myself. I really do. I suppose I‚Äôve been in my own echo chamber of self-hatred long enough that it‚Äôs quite difficult to put faith in anything otherwise anymore, but I‚Äôm going to sleep after a short cry and hope that all there is in my head after writing this is some semblance of peace. I hope I can find respite in empty dreams, and in the morning, I hope I can wake up a little braver than I have been for a while."

I was diagnosed with Panic disorder and Generalized anxiety disorder when I was only 9 years old, so I‚Äôm used to it at this point after almost 20 years of panic attacks every day.

But two nights ago it was a really bad one, worse than I‚Äôd had in a LONG time. It lasted for four and a half hours straight and I couldn‚Äôt sit down, couldn‚Äôt breathe, couldn‚Äôt feel anything physically. I genuinely was convinced I was dying and was begging my boyfriend to take me to the er, which he didn‚Äôt because he understood it was merely anxiety.

Around 4 AM I finally calmed down after a night of endless panic. Nothing usually helps calm me down so I have to wait for it to end. I usually just close my eyes and pray for it to end. But afterwards, I didn‚Äôt feel.. that relief. That relief I usually feel after I calm down and realize I‚Äôm not dying. I still felt... numb. Not just mentally, but physically. And the feeling has not disappeared. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not hungry, I don‚Äôt feel like talking, I feel exhausted mentally and physically, I haven‚Äôt been able to leave my house or even get up to shower. I still feel so physically numb and mentally drained.

I have struggled with sleep since I was about 13, I am now 22. I am unable to just ¬´fall asleep¬ª unless it‚Äôs like 7-8am in the morning no matter when I wake up unless I use sleeping aids. 

I have struggled with nightmares for many years, every single night. Sometimes they are just anxious dreams, sometimes they are really bad and will wake me up crying or delusional, for example convinced my bf is out to Get me or is gonna hurt me. He is amazing and have never or would never. The nightmares are sometimes very graphic and horrible and Feel very real to the point where I struggle to separate them from reality. 

I never Feel rested when I wake up (unless I get like 3 hours of sleep or no sleep at all then I Get really energetic and funny), and I usually wake up several times a night. I dread going to sleep every night because my thoughts start racing and they never seem to stop and I go dark places, Get reminded of trauma, Feel guilty for thinking about this trauma and so on. 

So naturally I have tried a lot. Alcohol, weed, seroquel, all the different kinds of sleeping meds, melatonin... coke to avoid sleeping lol... My doctor won‚Äôt give me the ¬´good stuff¬ª for more than a month because I can get addicted. I‚Äôve mostly stopped drinking and completely stopped smoking (or any other drugs) because I Get paranoid and mild psychosis like symptoms. Seroquel really helped but after a while I started getting restless legs so that stopped me from falling asleep. 

Lately I‚Äôve been taking a lot of anxiety meds every night to knock me out because I‚Äôm exhausted, I just want to sleep. But they in turn make my nightmares Worse. They are highly addictive and I am now scared I‚Äôm addicted as it only takes two weeks, but it feels more mental than physical atm.

Not being able to eat because you feel nauseous, getting anxious because you're not eating, anxiety then causing more nausea and so on. 

For me this culminates in going to dinner with friends or family as potentially the most stressful situation. The very first time I had a panic attack I was at lunch with my family and I just couldn't eat. I felt like everyone was noticing I was just pushing my food around. I got super stressed and went to the bathroom and had a massive panic attack. Had no idea what was happening and it was all very scary. 

These days, whenever my friends want to go to a restaurant or my family invites me over for dinner I get pangs of anxiety and nausea about not being able to eat. I worry I'll throw up or get weird looks cause I've ordered a meal and can't eat it. Usually it's fine but as we all know that doesn't matter with anxiety. Always ""but what if it's different this time.""

It doesn't help that I'm naturally quite lean so I can feel like people might think I'm avoiding eating or something. Or a grandparent goes ""oh you're so skinny you better eat up!""

This went on until I finally graduated and wanted to make a change for the better. I told my parents that I felt that something was off, and they listened this time. I went to a psychiatrist and it turns out I had obvious Asperger patterns and severe ADD. Once I got my medications I felt a sudden boost in that's weird to describe.

179,NumerousGarbage9032, ,0,Anxiety,1603500523,"Tips for anyone thinking about trying meditation Just thought I'd share a few things I learned. This has just been my experience 

- If you think meditation is always new agey or requires sitting in the classic Buddhist lotus pose, it can be those things but there is a wide variety of techniques and some are nothing like that.

- Sometimes guided meditation is easier. If you're not into going to a temple, center, etc, there are a lot of guided meditations on YouTube

- You don't have to meditate for hours, there are 5 and 10 minute guided ones that I found much easier to start with. It takes some getting used to!

- Consistency is key. Meditating every now and then can be relaxing, but to have an impact on your overall well being, it's best to do it daily. I still struggle with the discipline to do this!

- Don't beat yourself up if you find yourself slacking, whether during a meditation or just falling out of the habit. Just pick it back up again and move forward.

Hope someone finds this helpful. I'm by no means a regular meditator or an expert, these are all just things I found to be true for me."

Then after 2 hours, he tells me that it's his sister engagement party, so I'm like oooooh, I'm happy for her, she is a sweet girl... 

But me being the anxious girl, I broke down again, kept crying and crying, I think those were tears of relief... 

So thank you anxiety, for making me feel like a drama queen...

183,babybitchfriend2,Relationship,10,Anxiety,1603497809,"Anxiety In a Relationship Tip! Hey! I have struggled with anxiety for several years, and my boyfriend and I have both been having a hard time dealing with my anxiety in the context of the relationship. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship this serious, and I love my boyfriend more than anything ever. I truly believe he‚Äôs the person I‚Äôm meant to be with for my entire life.

But sometimes the part of my brain that is anxiety tells me that I‚Äôm not good enough, or pretty enough, or a bad influence, and all sorts of stuff that amount to ‚Äúhe needs better than you‚Äù and it recently has caused a bit of a breakdown and a very tense week between my and my dearest, but it‚Äôs over now and we both believe the rough patch is over and we are okay.

Something that has actually been helping me a lot be in a better headspace is that we have a ‚ÄúGood Day Streak‚Äù tally on our fridge, and every day that passed without any severe anxiety attacks we both celebrate in some small way and put a tally up! I‚Äôm 5 days without an incident, and it may seem small but it‚Äôs really helped me have something to be proud of myself about. 

I think it‚Äôs important to celebrate the good days, not just the great ones. I spend too much time looking back on the bad mental health days wishing I hadn‚Äôt felt like that that I forget to think about the good days. 

I recommend this for anyone needing a reason to look forward to the next day. 

TLDR: keeping a tally of my good mental health days has given me a reason to be proud of myself, and I truly feel like I‚Äôm making progress with my anxiety, highly recommend! :)"

185,ItsAnEagleNotARaven,Trigger Warning,20,Anxiety,1603497799,"TW child loss. I have had so much anxiety about COVID due to PTSD and today my husband tested positive. Background- in 2008 I had my first child. He was born with HLHS (heart defect) and needed a transplant. Shortly after his transplant he was backsliding with breathing on his own, and long story short, he died of a viral lung infection called Adenovirus. It typically causes a cold and only is vaccinated for in the military. Because he was immunosuppressed for his heart, it ravaged his lungs. He died at 5 months and 9 days old. He never left the hospital, and was always in the ICU so I never spent a single over night with him. I was 19 when he was born and just turned 20 when he passed. I got pregnant right away. Normal healthy pregnancy, but during the H1N1. I was so sure it would take my second from me. It didn't. But I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop every day since. I went on to have two more healthy babies and I've always been low key convinced I wasn't supposed to be a mom and something would happen to them too.

As a result, I'm a FREAK about getting them vaccinations on time and even crazier about flu season. I haven't slept well since COVID started which is especially hard because I have narcolepsy. It's been an unending cycle of panic, stay up late, sleep fitfully, ve useless and tired all day, repeat. 

My husband's coworker recently tested positive for COVID but was asymptomatic so my husband got tested just to be safe. Well it came back positive today. I've had a sore throat for a few days and felt some chest tightness but not coughing and no fever.  My middle child has a sore throat and no fever.

I feel like my world is coming to a full stop and this is that other shoe dropping. There is nothing I can do but wait and see. We're all getting tested tomorrow. It just feels like the day my son started going downhill but on an even bigger scale with less information and guidance. I'm 32 but I may as well be 19 again and feeling like I have no control over anything.

And I have to do it all in secret because I don't want my kids to be scared."

However I've always relied on certain people or family to be there for me or to hangout with. I have about three in real life friends, one from high school and then that persons sister/her boyfriend. 

Because they have really ill mothers and they take this pandemic extremely seriously (which is good) I haven't been able to see them. It's been months and it sucks because they were my only source of socialization when it came to my group age (in my 20s). 

Besides that...I usually hang out with my aunt or my dad/stepmom. My mom is a nurse so she's always working but then she moved out of our house to live with her boyfriend. For the most part I'm okay with it because we fought all of the time and I feel very free to do whatever I want in my house now. Also I don't get yelled at anymore so that's a plus lmao. 

However...I just realized HOW lonley I am. 

I don't hangout with my family as much anymore. I tried to so much in 2020 and I felt so unappreciated, not to mention a lot of dumb family drama stuff so I'm not in the mood to get hurt. And then like I said I don't see my friends anymore because of the pandemic. 

I spend most of my time either at work or by myself at my house. Work is work though...I mean I have a few laughs with my coworkers and I talk to customers but it's hollow because it's just a job. It's not like it actually impacts my outside social life because I'm not friends with any of my new coworkers yet. 

So since that doesn't count I literally have almost no form of socialization. I live with my brother but it's a little fucking odd ngl. He's ALWAYS in his room which again isn't the worst scenario because I like being alone but it's to the point where he will spend an entire day in his room. He loves video games I guess. 

As a result I end up spending the entire day alone...texting a few people here and there that I know from Twitter and that's it. I feel very scared and lost and alone all of the time. Internally....I just don't feel like a person anymore. I feel like I'm kinda of just living and existing. I wake up, then I go to work, then I come home and that's it. I'm stuck in my own thoughts and my own personal hell. Tbh I kinda hate myself...because I'm ALWAYS alone.

213,techdurecki,Discussion,0,Anxiety,1609835723,"Is Food The Enemy Of Anxiety? As someone who has suffered from anxiety for many years, and seems to slowly be making improvements and figuring things out, it is now my opinion that diet is the catalyst for anxiety in many people.  


There are certainly other causes of anxiety, or things that make anxiety worse.   Dehydration is a proven one, for example.   Inability to manage actual stress is another.   Lack of sleep.  Etc. etc.  But I do think one's diet is one of the biggest factors in a lot of cases.  


This is all my opinion, and I'm posting this to incite a discussion from others that may have their own experiences to share around food/diet experimentation and if it made them feel any better or worse.  There have certainly been some other posts in the past about diet, etc. but I just wanted to share maybe a slightly different view on it in hopes that I might help someone.  


Here are some foundational thoughts &amp; theory that I have about this... if one's anxiety isn't 24/7, all day everyday... if there are some GOOD days mixed in when someone feels happy and/or has very little anxiety... WHY?   What is DIFFERENT about those good feeling days compared to the awful high anxiety days?   What changed?  


It's my belief that it points to something BIOCHEMICAL as the culprit or at least a large contributor.  Outside of managing emotions/stress, I believe it comes down to two main factors:  


1.  Vitamins &amp; Minerals - not getting enough of certain things that contributes to the anxiety, or a problem with the body's ability to absorb/use them if it does get them.  

2.  Food Allergies &amp; Food Sensitivities - there has been a lot of research on the ""gut-brain axis"" and how inflammation in the gut can send distress signals to the brain and also mess with the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and other 'feel good' chemicals.

If someone suffering from anxiety has some actual 'feel good' days that are separate from the terrible, intense anxiety days, it sure seems plausible that the only thing that has changed is biochemistry and that biochemistry will fluctuate primarily from diet.  


If a ketogenic diet can help some people with seizures, dementia, schizophrenia, etc. and is now proven research, that's absolute proof that diet can change biochemistry and ultimately change mental health in some people.    No, I'm not saying that it's the cure for everyone.   But the correlations cannot be denied.  


Some people have gone on Carnivore diets and experienced huge differences in anxiety/depression levels.   Now I don't think it's the meat per se that's making them feel better, I think more than anything a Carnivore diet is a major Elimination Diet.  It's very possible that those people feeling better have food sensitivities causing their anxiety (and or at least making it much worse) and eating only meat simply eliminates their consumption of whatever they were sensitive to - dairy, gluten, soy, corn, shellfish, nuts, whatever.  


So with all this being said... QUESTION FOR YOU...  


Have you personally done any experimenting with an Elimination Diet?   Have you tried cutting out dairy for example for a couple of weeks and see how it made you feel?   Or cutting out a group of things?   The anecdotal reports from many people that have reduced their anxiety with diet changes say that the anxiety level often ""lags"" the diet reaction/change.  In other words, someone might eat something today that they are sensitive to yet won't feel more anxiety until 1-3 days later - which makes pinpointing food issues more challenging.  It sure would be great if we ate something and instantly had more anxiety and could tell it was from that food itself so we'd know to not eat it.   But it apparently takes a few days.  


For me personally, some of my worst anxiety 'episodes' seem to last about 3 days.  Then it seems to fade a bit.   Then it may go back up again, not always as intense as the worst days.   But rarely have I ever had the massive intense anxiety for more than about 3 days in a row.  My hypothesis is that this is how long it takes for inflammation in the gut to subside after eating something I was really sensitive to.  Now certainly if someone was sensitive to something, and it caused their anxiety to intensify, AND they ate that food everyday for a month, well there's a very good chance they may have the intense anxiety reaction for a month because they continue to eat it.  


Would love to hear about your diet experimentations and how it affected your anxiety levels.  And do you recall some very HAPPY days mixed in with your anxiety days, and what is your guess on WHY that happened?"

Out of curiosity I thought hmm where could this anxiety come from, I realized my father takes medication for social anxiety/depression, so did his grandmother. There seems to be some strong genetic component towards mental illness. It makes sense when you think about it, the great question is why dont all people develop mental illness? even those who suffer from great lenghts (like the holocaust). I think inheritance of resiliency is definitely through temperaments which comes from genetics. In my situation, a simple matter of people laughing at me caused my anxiety."

I don‚Äôt know where it started for me. I use to get paranoid when smoking weed as a teenager. Was always the, ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù friend. I had my fair share drug usage. I vaped/smoked for 10 years. I‚Äôm overweight, 6,2 270 pounds but I‚Äôm not out of shape. I use to lift weights a lot. I wrestled and played football. I am 22 years young. I quit smoking weed last December because I was supposed to get into an apprenticeship but due to Covid it got pushed back I didn‚Äôt have any anxiety or any palpitations or any issues prior to Covid I started smoking weed again in about July and I had my first panic attack ever other than a bad trip. I was convinced I was going to die the most frightening experience of my life my heart was racing I was sweating I couldn‚Äôt breathe and it was like a knot was building up in everyone of my organs. The panic attack was sparked by smoking a wax pen and my tolerance was low and I was also stressed out because we had to set up camp during the dark. At this time I was still using nicotine. I continue to smoke with mild panic attacks for the next couple months and eventually quit smoking for good around September it seems this is when the anxiety attacks started to get really bad. I was having heart flutters weekly breathing issues weekly and just  wasn‚Äôt feeling like my normal self. I figured I would quit nicotine and maybe this would solve things I was honestly almost at the healthiest point in my life I wasn‚Äôt smoking weed or using nicotine or drinking or anything I lost 30 pounds too. The anxiety just kept getting worse though no I like to think I‚Äôm an intelligent guy in the world that we are living in today it‚Äôs just too much for me to handle I feel like I used to be addicted to looking and social media and debating with people about current events and affairs I could go on and on there‚Äôs a lot of things that I look at for the cause of my anxiety but where I‚Äôm currently at I‚Äôm seeing a therapist which I don‚Äôt believe in but I give it a shot i‚Äôve been taking a daily medication that it‚Äôs done nothing for me I‚Äôm not prescribe Xanax but I take it almost on the daily now without it I wouldn‚Äôt be able to work or concentrate when the panic attack kicks in I try and ride it out for about 30 minutes to an hour and it just progressively gets worse it starts as a dull pain in the chest and builds up to breathing issues heaviness in the chest and a fear of impending doom I‚Äôve been to the hospital approximately four times now for Extreme panic attacks where I thought I was going to die for sure. I‚Äôve been to some pretty serious stuff I had my appendix irrupt and that can kill you it was very painful. I would say these panic attacks are far worse daily I wonder if I have gotten Covid or when I get it what  will happen to me. I think about all the drugs and all the stuff I smoked and consumed in the past and think about how much I regret doing all these things that did harm in my body. Are used to smoke a lot both weed cigarettes vaping you name it. It seems like I felt more healthy pre-Covid and now the different world that we‚Äôre living in it‚Äôs like I live in constant worry constant anxiety although it‚Äôs almost as if my anxiety comes out of nowhere and like God is just turning on a light switch for no reason. I was never a drinker but have just started taking it up frequent because I can‚Äôt handle smoking anymore. I also have a very embarrassing issue that affects my self-esteem I‚Äôm not gonna go into detail I feel like what would really help me is just somebody to love, to live on my own for the end for the World to go back to normal most importantly I feel like my anxiety has begun now because I‚Äôve never been aware of the world or never took note of my own health until Covid.

I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years now and we‚Äôve been best friends for almost 4. I‚Äôm 20 and she‚Äôs 18.
I am a very physical person and I connect mostly with people by touch. I will always give hugs and whenever I‚Äôm with friends I‚Äôm always somewhat close to someone. Anyway...

At the beginning of this pandemic I was forced to social distance with my girlfriend for 2 months. I was still allowed to meet up with her in public places and talk but we couldn‚Äôt touch. For the most part I was ok when I was with her but as soon as I had to say goodbye without giving her a hug I would breakdown. This went on almost everyday for two months. Eventually the public health order was released and I was able to see her again about halfway through summer and all was well in the world. Then the second wave hit and we had to social distance again. 

This time it was a lot harder for me and I would often get anxiety attacks throughout the day that would make me have to stop whatever I was doing till I calmed down. Thankfully that only lasted for 3 weeks then I was able to see her again. 

A couple months later now and I‚Äôm starting to get separation anxiety even though I‚Äôm still allowed to see her. It almost feels like PTSD from when I had to social distance the last two times and it‚Äôs only getting worse.

I've (20f) always had anxiety about certain things but for some reason or another in high school my brain latched onto math. I've always struggled with the concept of not being good/smart enough so I think this is just a manifestation of those fears. I would always dread going to my math classes and would regularly have panic attacks anytime I was taking a test. I've been wanting to go to university to get the science degree I've always wanted. The downside is I have to do A LOT of Math so I'm hoping to get this under control and not let it hold me back.

232,zentaco,Medication,2,Anxiety,1609831050,"How to deal with intense medication anxiety? I‚Äôve been dealing with my anxiety for years and started the meds route a few years ago. My first try was Zoloft and I ended up at urgent care after 3 doses and severely ramped up anxiety/insomnia/palpitations (and some bonus vomiting). Now traumatized by that, I started Gabapentin. This hasn‚Äôt been too terrible, but if I miss a dose I get insomnia and I suspect it gives me memory issues. 

My psychiatrist wants me to add a mood stabilizer but I have low tolerance for side effects. I briefly tried to add propranolol but it made me sluggish; I hated it as I need to get stuff done during the day to feel satisfaction. Bupropion gave me less severe insomnia and irritability, plus tinnitus. They then suggested topiramate but I developed tinnitus again. Now they want me to try Latuda, but there are some genuinely scary side effects listed.

The thing that I often worry about is that one of my old friends who I haven't talked to in about 2-3 years will leak our old texts from messenger and take them out of context and use them to make people believe that I'm whatever their accusing me of being since they have ""evidence"" I know that everyone on YouTube and journalist will post videos/articles talking about me and will probably agree with the claims since there would be ""evidence"" however if I wanted to defend myself and give actual context for the texts I would only have my word since I no longer have that Facebook account anymore. I think I worry about this because recently I've seen so many people get old texts leaked and have stuff taken out of context and be accused of whatever and have lost fans, jobs, sponsors, even friends for something that wasn't true or was taken out of context but in the end they were able to defend themselves because they still had the texts but since I don't I'm afraid if something like that were to happen to me nobody would believe me even if I am telling the truth and I end up losing fans, sponsors, friends, and jobs. I know that I overthink this and that these people were already famous when they sent those things were taken out of context and I'm still nobody and like I said it's been 2-3 years since I've deleted Facebook so it's possible that all my old friends don't even have those texts anymore or even a Facebook account and probably haven't thought of me in years and have moved on in life. So I want to give a little context all the people that I used to talked to on messenger were my friends in high school and my ex girlfriend we're all out of high school now and at one point I had a very bad mental and emotional breakdown to where I was on the verge of suicide every night I thought of death but luckily for me I had a few friends who were there for me and helped me out so I would tell them that I love them and care about them and they were an angle for basically saving my life since I was very close to just ending it all and thank them for being there for me. 

So I guess I'm afraid they would leak and take those messages out of context and some how use them against me and honestly that scares me because I've been put on medication I'm in a far better place both mentally and emotionally and would really like to move on from the past but just knowing that if I do what I really want to and I get big people who I used to call my friends can easily leak our old texts and make me look however they want me to look. Another thing that I thought about my mom came over for Christmas and I know she doesn't delete anything so I asked her if we could look through her messenger to see if we could find my old account so we looked through all the Facebook User accounts in her messenger but none of the messages would load it would all just say unreadable so I don't know if after awhile the messages won't load or what. However I still worry about old high school friends recognizing me and i don't know be mad that I don't talk to them anymore and decide to leak our old texts to try and hurt me. I know this is really dumb and I'm overthinking things that more than likely will never happen but it makes me not want to upload or make anything and I really can't stop thinking/worrying about it and I really don't know what to do about it."

Simple tasks like going outside or driving my dog suddenly throw me into an existential crisis. The focus of this anxiety? Death. I can't go longer than an hour without reminding myself that I will one day no longer experience consciousness. That is absolutely terrifying for me. I know there is something to be said for acknowledging death and living life to the fullest, but death has become constantly present in my conscious thought. I find myself unable to enjoy anything and the reminder of death acts as an intrusive thought that completely steals any ounce of joy I may have briefly been experiencing.

I am currently in talk therapy and starting medication soon, but I am worried that this will be an issue that I will deal with for the rest of my life. I'm currently 23 and a recent college graduate in a happy relationship. I am applying to law schools for next fall and I feel like I should be on cloud nine with the joy of beginning a career I know I will enjoy. Instead, I find myself experiencing low-grade anxiety all day, and the thought of death always on my mind. I also have at least one panic attack nightly as I find myself unable to distract myself and start diving into the specific thoughts about how exactly it will happen and what it will feel like.

I'm experiencing constant derealization as well, no doubt as a result of this anxiety, and this also fuels y fear as I feel like I'm not even fully experiencing my life while I actually am here. I often find myself scouring the internet for answers. This scouring often sends me right back into the arms of another panic attack. I find that everything that everyone says makes it worse. When people say I should just ""man up"" and face the reality, the panic becomes worse. When people dive into the logistics of death, again the panic gets worse. When people talk about diet and exercise, I feel like they don't understand how severe my problem actually is.

I guess what I'm asking for here, other than space for a colossal rant, is if anyone has experienced this and what they did to overcome it. I'd also like to know if there are any older people here who used to feel this way. I think having proof that my perspective will eventually change will also make me feel better.

265,kenziepartiess,Family/Relationship,2,Anxiety,1609817589,"// (tw: emotional abuse, panic attack, ed) terrible, awful panic attack I‚Äôm three weeks sober. I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression in my first year of college. My father is mostly absent and my mom is my life long bully. She gets unreasonably angry over little things and then says whatever she knows will put you down. Most of my insecurities were bred at home. I try really really hard to not take it personally because she‚Äôs had a very difficult life, but she and I have gotten into physical alterations over some of the shit she says. I don‚Äôt visit home for long periods of time, and when I do, I can‚Äôt stay at my moms. Because of the pandemic, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable staying with non family so when I visited I decided to just crash on mom‚Äôs couch, thinking I‚Äôd only be here until the new year and it was NBD. 

A few days ago, my mom and sister got into a fight. My mom kicked in my sisters door, breaking door frame and terrorizing everyone in the house. I begged her not to kick the door down but she pushed me aside and insisted on doing it. I yelled at her because I don‚Äôt like seeing my sibling bullied. We had a whole screaming match and then we went to separate rooms to cool down. She then dropped my sister off at my dads house, because she felt like she could ‚Äúchoke her‚Äù. The fight was over something stupid but my mom, obviously, has anger issues and blew everything out of proportion. 

As a symptom of my PTSD, I really fucking hate yelling - being yelled at, hearing others yell, having to yell myself, all of these things are triggering. I really wanted to go to a protest in my city this past summer, but couldn‚Äôt even bear to leave the house when I heard the shouting. However, I have a few years of therapy under my belt and felt brave enough to try and have an adult conversation about it. As we were on the highway driving away from my dads place, I told my mom that she has fucking issues and should go to therapy. She didn‚Äôt respond well and called a family friend. They both ganged up on me, called me disrespectful and rude. I snapped and told my mom that she makes me feel like shit and that I‚Äôm on all these pills and going to therapy five times a month because she doesn‚Äôt know how to communicate or parent effectively. As this is happening, she becomes more and more irate and begins taking her hands off the steering wheel. While we‚Äôre on the highway, surrounded by cars. 

She‚Äôs yelling and screaming and accusing me all while the car drifts in and out of the lane because she‚Äôs literally not even touching the steering wheel, not even with her legs, all while driving 70-80 mph. I feel a panic attack coming on so i stop responding and just try and chill out. I could‚Äôve vomited, but I don‚Äôt really eat anything around her lest she bully me and eating also makes me anxious, so i was just dry heaving. Something in the back of my head was like ‚Äúgod I wish she would just crash into the median, I‚Äôd feel a lot safer‚Äù and some other, more suicidal things I won‚Äôt bring up. I start pulling out my eyebrows which i haven‚Äôt done since high school. And then my hands go numb like i can‚Äôt feel anything at all except a stinging sensation when i open and close my hands. I start to panic more and punch my self in the legs and face, trying to regain feeling. And I can feel more of my body getting numb. I didn‚Äôt know what to think or do. Going numb made me more panicked than i‚Äôve ever been. I began sobbing and hyperventilating. Mom rolled her eyes and told our family friend that i was being ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù.

Since the attack, I‚Äôve explained to my mom that her crazy driving gave me a panic attack and, for that reason, I‚Äôm returning to my own home because being around her is bad for my mental health. She completely refused to take responsibility and straight up said she‚Äôs the safest driver I know (she and I have been in five car accidents together, so that‚Äôs laughable). She then began to buy me lots of random gifts and food and even offered to buy me an emotional support animal. I then realized she was just trying to emotionally manipulate me into staying. The mother I used to have sympathy despite our differences for has no sympathy for me and the only way I know how to deal with this is by running away from it. I‚Äôm very sad because i‚Äôll miss my siblings but staying here is testing me in a way that‚Äôs jeopardizing my sobriety and mental health. 

TLDR: my mom is a bully who won‚Äôt take responsibility for the effect she has in my mental health, so I have to leave and miss out on family time to avoid interactions with her that could jeopardize my mental health and sobriety"

270,sweetjack36,Medication,0,Anxiety,1609816413,"SSRI‚Äôs and Hormones Hi all. Just wanted to share my story in hopes I can help someone else struggling.

I have suffered from anxiety for about 15 years now. It started when I was a child as I was a product of 2 alcoholic parents. It has ping-ponged over the years between codependency, general anxiety and OCD. The remaining culprits are general anxiety and OCD, as I was able to shake the codependency via therapy and meditation.

A few months ago I started a generic of Zoloft. I have always been relatively against medication (for myself) and proffered the natural remedies, but I didn‚Äôt want to be stubborn and figured I would give it a try.

The first week was of course tough; I was drowsy, foggy and generally a bit out of it. Once the initial onboard wore off, however, I was feeling really good. It genuinely made me feel more relaxed and at ease. 

Once I was on 50mg for some time I started to feel anxious again, and also felt some need sensations that weren‚Äôt overly warm and fuzzy; nervousness, worrying. I could feel my OCD kicking into overdrive. I of course reached out to my PCP and her suggestion was more Zoloft. So I upped to 75, then to 100. The symptoms got worse and I also developed an acne-plagued face (super cute, I know). I was feeling very agitated and emotional. 

My wheels started turning and I realized there was another time in my life that ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù made me feel this way. Hormonal birth control. I bounced between a few over the years - the pill, nuvaring, nexplanon. All of them made me feel a bit edgy, but the nexplanon was a whole new level of crazy. It made me feel like I wanted to rip someone‚Äôs head off...literally all the time. I was sleeping, a lot. Very emotional. Felt tense quite literally for most of the day. Worried. Anxious. Over compulsive. I spoke to my OBGYN at the time and she expressed that I am ‚Äúhormone sensitive‚Äù and a hormonal-free IUD was probably the answer for me. I started the copper IUD (Paraguard) and felt amazing. Although I still struggled with some general anxiety, those other terrible feelings seemed to go away. 

I asked my doctor if there was a correlation between SSRI‚Äôs and hormone levels. She said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so‚Äù. How insightful. I work in Pharma, specifically in clinical trials, so I thought I‚Äôd give a shot to doing my own research. Low and behold - there is absolutely a connection. I‚Äôm not going to go into all the science jargon, but basically, because SSRI‚Äôs regulate ‚Äúmood‚Äù they can mess with certain hormone receptors and effect levels. If you naturally have high hormone levels (like me) this could be bad news bears for you. If your hormone levels are low, you could be one of the lucky ones that benefit significantly from SSRI‚Äôs.

I am no doctor. And I am not saying that anti-depressants are bad. I just wanted to share my story in case anyone is thinking about trying them out and has had issues with hormones in the past. 

I would also love to hear anyone else‚Äôs experience with SSRI‚Äôs and if you‚Äôve had a similar scenario?"
271,iCantEv3n,Advice Needed,4,Anxiety,1609816165,"Am I Experiencing Heart Palpitations? **TLDR;** I mysteriously experience constant pounding heart beat and aching with deep breaths in my lower neck area for 1-2 weeks once a year every year. Lab tests show no physical signs and I think it might be anxiety related.

Every now and then for the past 5 years or so, at least once a year I feel my heart beat pounding in my neck/collar bone area and a dull ache every time I take a deep breath. It is pretty much constant. Some days are worse than others where it gets pretty debilitating, and it always gets worse at night and when I lay down/bend over. This usually persists for 1-2 weeks and magically disappears as mysteriously as it arose.

I have been to the doctor for it several times. One doc diagnosed it as pleurisy and prescribed me a steroid pack which did nothing, and I even went to a cardiologist to do a stress test, which just exacerbated things, but my blood pressure, EKG, respiratory rate, and bloodwork showed nothing other than I am a physically healthy dude in his early 20s. 

I have done a bunch of research myself and am not sure if it is heart palps or not because they are always present during those 1-2 weeks, and the research I have done says heart palps come and go in short bouts. I have come to the conclusion its gotta be anxiety related because there are no physical signs pointing to anything abnormal. 

I don't have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, but have sought out counselors at my schools several times when I was feeling overwhelmed, but those times these ""heart palps"" weren't present so I literally don't know wtf triggers them. I have been feeling very anxious in recent months after being in social settings dwelling on things I said or did that made me seem stupid or weird, which new because I've always been a social person. I do have ADHD but I know its not the meds because they actually calm me down and quiet my mind and I wasn't diagnosed the first several times this appeared.

I can only occupy myself so much before the thoughts of worry just creep in."
275,randomgirl2588,Venting,2,Anxiety,1609815591,"I hate that I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm anxious. At least with health anxiety I knew why. So years ago I suffered from severe health anxiety. I was always at my doctors or going to A&amp;E after self diagnosing myself with a terminal illness and then having panic attacks and thinking that I was dying. I eventually got the anxiety under control and was fine for 5-6 years. 

 I have now relapsed but I am not experiencing health anxiety. I‚Äôm just experiencing anxiety. I‚Äôm having panic attacks, feeling irritable, depersonalisation etc etc but I‚Äôm not worried about my health. But it‚Äôs weird because when I had health anxiety at least I knew why I was anxious. I was anxious because I had a pain in my head and as I became more in control I could beat the anxiety by being rational. 

I have no idea how to tackle my anxiety at the moment because I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm anxious.  And I know that some say knowing why you‚Äôre anxious isn‚Äôt important, it‚Äôs knowing how to manage it. But unfortunately I like to know the in‚Äôs and outs of everything so I like to know why I‚Äôm experiencing something or feeling a certain way. So it‚Äôs weird that I don‚Äôt know.

276,Additional-Draft-930,Venting,1,Anxiety,1609815512,"So today I think I figured out that I have anxiety? I'm not the sharpest bulb in the basket, but somehow I managed to realize that my stress level is disproportionate to the actual stress in my life.

I've been repeating ""I'm a full-time single dad with a full-time job, of course I'm stressed"" for so long that I never really paused to think about it much. People have been worried about me a bit, but I dismissed that worry as them not knowing what it's like, you know?

But very recently the idea trickled into my head that, logically, there's nothing terrible going on in my life right now. Yeah, I live paycheck to paycheck, but decently-so - I've been slowly climbing out of debt for the last two years, and I even have some in savings now, so money can't be causing me that much stress.

The other things weren't adding up to my stressed-out-my-eyeballs level I've been stuck in for a long time. Yeah, I haven't gotten laid in two years (and it's going to be a lot longer before that even becomes a possibility again), but, again, that's not nearly enough.

So I googled anxiety at work today. One of the results sends you into a little quiz to see what you've got/how bad it is. The result was ""moderate anxiety.""

My problem with the quiz was that there was no baseline to compare my current situation to. Sure, I'm stressed now, but compared to when?

When I was 22 I lived with a meditating community in a mountain resort. I meditated for eight hours a day, studied various scripture, and hung out with my friends. Fifteen years later, I'm (as said above), a single dad with a job. Am I supposed to compare the two? Of course I'm more stressed today than I was then!

But this idea of me ""having anxiety"" as something more external, a situation that I can manage and possibly overcome with deliberate effort, that's something I can wrap my head around - and it's already making me feel a lot better.

And it explains a lot! Like:

- My hair-trigger annoyance-to-grumpy-to-angry over tiny things
- My stress eating to the point of discomfort while still feeling hungry (and eating a lot of sugar)
- My inability to think or plan, or keep track of a moderate list of chores/errands
- My insomnia (although that's been a lifelong thing)
- This feeling like my guts are all twisted up in a tight knot all of the time (I had a colonoscopy because of this that came back clean)
- the stress, almost overwhelming at times, over seemingly nothing at all
- other muscle/body tightness, especially my left shoulder, which I hold tight like God is trying to rip it off me
- extreme frustration at my admittedly pretty good life situation
- to some extent, my agoraphobia (crowds do me in bad, I've been OK with the lack of going to bars during COVID. I really can't handle crowds at all).
- and, finally, that one symptom I read today that made it all click (as said above): feelings of stress disproportionate to the actual stress triggers

Anyway, I just wanted to get all of this off my chest. I'm going to look up lifestyle adjustments/treatments and start tackling this thing head-on. I'm also thinking about calling up my doctor and see if this makes sense to him (and by way of apologizing for the unneeded colonoscopy. 

I know I can go back to that good place again, but clearly it's going to take some effort to get there. I'm up to the task - after all, the job is making myself healthier, and that is always worthwhile."

I have a horrible anxiety disorder that was accelerated by my traumatic breakup. After my breakup I was so damaged by the emotional trauma I started having regular panic attacks and quit a lot of jobs impulsively due to that. Other things happened as well due to my breakup such as a short xanax addiction, nicotine addiction and a small deal of suicide attempts (real physical attempts.

I processed the majority of my heartbreak feelings months ago and have been doing great in terms of my life and social life, etc. But some bullshit happened regarding my insanely crazy and toxic ex and her new boyfriend.

I found out she had a boyfriend last night and the news really shocked me, it was like a wave of jealousy engulfed my soul. My ex getting in another relationship (for context we were our firsts for everything) was something I tried hard to emotionally prepare for. I was praying that I would be in a relationship by the time this happened.

But today my friend told me that my ex's boyfriend threatened him. It all started with literally nothing, my friend sent an innocent selfie to some of his friends including my ex's roommate. I guess her roomate told her and this somehow resulted in my ex's boyfriend screaming and cursing at my friend and saying to never contact my ex again. I thought it was funny at first but now hearing all of this has rekindled my heartbreak a little bit. 

I keep imagining my ex and her new bf having sex and being intimate and the image of it won't leave my head. It's insane, if I'm not distracting myself I'm just constantly thinking about it. I'm constantly being haunted by it. I thought I had worked through this and gotten over my breakup but I guess not.

Of course the chest tickling and the chest burning could be totally unrelated. I already contacted my doctor via MyChart, and I have a telehealth appointment for tomorrow. But my anxiety is going off. Because chest pain must equal heart attack or angina or some kind of medical emergency.

At the end of the night i didnt feel well and vomited after too many glasses of johnnie walker and the cocaine didnt help im sure. Anyways i went home snd fell asleep and woke up. I started reading about the effects of cocaine and really freaked me out. Anyways in the last couple of months ive done an ECG test, a stress test on tbe treadmill, bloodwork, chest xray, chest ultrasound and all came out fine. So the heart seems fine.  

However i cant kick the anxiety, at night I take Lorazepam which helps me sleep and daytime im nit takimg anything as im trying not to be on too many meds but i cant seem to fight the anxiety so it appears i might have to day something in the day time to curb my anxiety.

292,BullsFan824,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1609812240,"My anxiety is getting worse. What should I do? This is going to be long, so my apologies for that, but I don‚Äôt want to leave anything out.

For some context, I have been dealing with anxiety for pretty much my whole life, but really started feeling it during my sophomore year of high school.  I struggled a ton with self-confidence, and put a lot of pressure on myself to get good grades to get into a good college. My lack of self-confidence and desire to be one of the best scholars in my class led to me always feeling anxious, and feeling that whenever I would do something fun that wasn‚Äôt physically active (like play video games), I was just wasting time and felt guilty that I wasn‚Äôt being productive.  This basically continued throughout high school, and I hoped that college would be less busy and give me an opportunity to thrive on my own schedule.

Throughout college, I actually just felt increasing levels of anxiety. I felt even more pressure to do well academically and be involved. I had very little time to myself, and struggled mightily still with social anxiety and confidence (although I faked it well enough to land a job as a resident assistant in the dorms).  When senior year approached, I especially felt anxious that I wouldn‚Äôt find a job, despite excelling up to that point in school. I had a bad experience at an internship (was a case of me finding a bad small company with not the best work culture, but I blamed it entirely on myself). I blamed myself for every little failure I had, and told myself that I was letting myself and my parents down if I didn‚Äôt find a job after graduating. 

I did find a job a few weeks after I graduated (just about half a year ago), and it‚Äôs been a work from home software developer job. The job itself is very nice (no complaints there), but I‚Äôve felt even more anxiety as a result of having my first decent-paying job. Whenever I struggle to solve a problem, I feel like I‚Äôm going to get fired. Whenever I ask a question, I feel like I am being a bother, and I feel like I am not working quickly enough because another new developer seems to be getting things done more quickly than me.  I constantly worry that I‚Äôm going to get fired, and don‚Äôt view myself as worth the money I‚Äôm making (even though I have gotten nothing but positive reviews up to this point).  As a result of this self-doubt, along with feeling guilty when not being productive, I‚Äôve been working far longer hours than I should be (some days working for 12 hours), and have a hard time focusing sometimes throughout the day because of how anxious I feel that I am messing something up (or eventually will mess something up).  

I have an amazing girlfriend too, but I worry that eventually my anxiety will be too much for her to handle, and that she will leave me (as a previous girlfriend has).  I also feel like a loser currently, as I am 23 years old and living at home (per the advice of my parents, who want me to save money at home before I move out, rather than rent and burn money that I could be saving. But still, the feeling of still living at home while others my age are not is not a great one).  

What do you suggest I do about this? How do I get rid of this productivity guilt, self-doubt, and just general anxiety? For those who might want to suggest medication, I have actually been on medication in the past for anxiety, but don‚Äôt feel like it made that significant of a difference.  Perhaps there is something else I can try, however. I am open to any suggestions.

There's a supervillain that is capable of exploding people's heads and she massacres almost half of a court house in one of the goriest scenes I've ever seen on TV. I always pretty shocked but then kept on watching till the end anyway, well, I spent the whole episode with this crippling fear that anyone's head was going to explode at any scene, which did happen to one character at the end, where they revealed who this supervillain is and that she would clearly take a major role on the next season, so I'm terrified of watching season 3 when it starts because I know that my anxiety is gonna spike when I do.

The thing is I really like the show and I'm attached to some of the characters but having someone that can just explode people's heads on the show is terrible, not because of the gore itself but because you never know when it's going to happen.

I'm 23 now and these last three years after having my daughter at 20 I fell into the worst post partum depression and with all the past trauma and abuse has been eating away at me and with no form of support I've kind of just been putting it aside and not really acknowledging I completely stopped all forms of hygiene including brushing my teeth. January I had a sort of awakening and realized that I no longer want to be sad and I need to take better care of my self. I started better taking care of teeth brushing twice a day, flossing and mouthwash. Yesterday I noticed that I can see two of my teeth through my gums. My gums are thinning. Not receding thankfully but my teeth all hurt now I took a picture of my teeth and never seen how truly ugly my teeth were and that I a 23 year have completely failed at taking care of my teeth. I can physically feel the anxiety just dragging me down and constantly reminding me that i will probably have to pull alot of teeth and I dont know how I will even begin to come up with the money for new teeth. I have been a full time parent to my daughter with not a single dollar to my name as soon as my SO other finds out the guilt that he will make me feel is not worth it. I have a dentist appointment tomorrow and I am hoping that anxiety just fully eat me away this time.

308,arpeemacmrfee,Venting,4,Anxiety,1612991538,"My anxiety story Hello r/anxiety 

I'm having a flare up of some longstanding anxiety problems which I'm finding quite difficult to deal with and I think that's partly my fault as I probably lost my focus after many years of being relatively anxiety-free. I guess this post is a way of me attempting to re-start that process.

I'm a guy, mid 40's, good job, happy home life, amazing wife and child-free by choice. I had a good, stable upbringing until my parents divorced when I was 12ish and that changed me in a number of ways and ultimately, I think, sowed the seeds for anxiety problems which surfaced later on...

Fast forward 10 years or so, I'm a young man living the dream, sharing a place with one of my best buddies (to this day), and doing what young adults do - being promiscuous, loud, drinking and experimenting with drugs. For a couple of years this was all good and then one night, we have some friends round and we're drinking, smoking weed, taking some amphetamines and I start having this horrible reaction. I didn't know it at the time but it was a panic attack and it was the first one of literally thousands which I would go on to have over the following years. I didn't say anything to anyone on that night - I didn't want to spoil anyone's night, so I just said I felt unwell and went to my room, and nobody knew what had happened. It stayed that way for the next 10 years - I lived with panic attacks almost daily and I never said a word to anyone about it. I developed all these strategies and tactics to cover it up, hide it and keep it inside. It was a fucking nightmare. 

So anyway, time goes by and I meet this nice girl, we start going out and after a few weeks we're on this date in a restaurant and I have this huge, horrendous panic attack. I can't hide it this time, it's too obvious, but luckily for me, my GF recognises what's happening, suggests we leave and once we get home, we start talking about it and I open up about all the above. She suggests I go and see the Doctor and a few days later, I'm opening up to him about it and get referred for a course of CBT.

Jump forward again and I complete my CBT course and then had private therapy sessions every week for about a year, by the end of which, I feel like a new person, free from the daily horrors of panic attacks, situation avoidance, hiding and covering up my condition. I start a new job, meet my (now) wife and settle down to live my life without anxiety, Until now...

Out of the blue, a couple of weeks ago, it's back. Like the proverbial bad penny. And here I am.

As it was back then, it is now, just a general heightened sense of anxiety ALL THE FUCKING TIME, with particularly bad symptoms at certain times, usually when I'm eating or speaking as I have this stupid fucking irrational thought about choking to death. This time though, I'm not going to have 10 years of hiding it and suffering, I'm going to confront it, and I will beat it again. Right now, I feel like shit but I also know I can and will overcome this, and to anyone who can relate to anything I've said, you can too.

Phew, Feel a bit better already. If you're still reading at this point, thank you and good luck on your own journey.

TL;DR - Anxiety can fuck right off."

Basically in every single one of my relationships im hyper aware of everything, its so annoying tbh, like so many things people would perceive as ""not a big deal"" my brain is like THREAT!!! ABORT NOWW! like for example over time a bunch of small things could happen (ex: not texting back, forgetting plans, etc). and my brain conjures up this very ""real"" (but usually not in reality) story of their motivations and how all of these small things MUST mean something bigger, and no one can convince me otherwise I swear. Im frustrated bc I am always playing some sort of detective in my relationships and their behavior always seems to lead to the worst case scenario of lying, not really liking me, or any other ulterior motive that is bad in that way. Im chronically retreating from friendships bc I feel like my version of events is so real, and it takes like a few weeks (sometimes months... but sometimes never) for me to second guess my thought process and try to rekindle the relationship. Also what's worse is that my brain is so persuasive at this that a lot of my friends and family AGREE with me most of the time. like they usually do not accept my radical behavior of cutting them off but they agree that I have good reason to be upset (which I guess validates me in a situation where I probs shouldn't be).

Anyways im extremely tired of being hyper aware of how my friends are feeling, and its so hard to convince/force myself to do ""thoughts on trial"" worksheets when I am fully strong in my belief. and also im sure its a HUGEEE strain to be my friend or bf when I am consistently acting like this, like friends deserve to have the benefit of the doubt and loved if they make mistakes. Just for context I have had anxiety and panic disorder for like 7 years (but both are so much better recently yay!!) and I do have ADHD.

315,DDioChama,Needs A Hug/Support,0,Anxiety,1612989284,"Wanting to break up, intrusive thoughts sometimes blocking romantic feeling towards a perfect partner. Is this caused by anxiety, or maybe ROCD? TL;DR Intrusive thoughts blocking romantic emotions towards my girlfriend to an extent that I think about breaking up with her eventhough there is nothing wrong with the relationship. My questions are at the bottom of the post. I'm also freshly diagnosed with bipolar disorder, maybe it's related to the issue I'm having 

I don't even know, where to start. There is this thing, in my heart, where I keep think that I need to break up. Every single time, when I remember that I have a girlfriend, when I remember that I love her, or I remember to her face. Although I know, that I love her. I really don't know, how to handle this. It feels like I have some kind of...I don't know, unrealistic thought of a ,,thorn"" in my mind, that I am unhappy with her. However, everytime, when go on a date with her, I had a wonderful time. We spent New Year's Eve together, and it was like in a fairy tale. I have never been so happy in my whole life. We watched fireworks from the balcony, we toasted with champagne (we never drank the whole night before) and everything was so perfect. Just like before at each occasion we've met. And after New Year's Eve, nothing wrong happened, which could have lead me to a conclusion, that breaking up is necessary. Yet, about 3-4 days ago, I keep waking up with this ,,thorn"".  


I keep persauding myself that I love her, I MUST love her, and deeply, under this thorn, I remember, that I do. I do know, yet I don't feel like it, when this thorn is around. Although I do possess the ability, to remember our good times, even when this thorn is around, and when I'm thinking about these memories, I forget these break-up thoughts. For a short amount of time, then this thorn empowers itself once again. I know, it's not her problem, since this thorn was in my mind in ALL of my previous relationships. These thorns started to pop up, just when things got well, and I felt myself happy. Then I started to feel this stuff, and when they were getting bigger, and more powerful, I ended up breaking up with my girlfriends, because this feeling started to be so excrutiating, that I felt, breaking up with them is the only way out from this suffer. For a few times, it was. For a few, when this thorny feeling ended ( possibly due to the break-up) we got together once again. But in any way, I always regretted, that I broke up with these girls. I can avoid these thoughts, I can avoid this thorn sometimes, when I distract my attention, but then, like instantly, this thing just pops back to my head. It pops up, and it keeps telling me: ,,Greg, you have to break-up. You'll never be happy, if you don't"". It doesn't even says I'm not happy in this relationship. It just makes me to FEEL that way. Possibly due to these thoughts. But this voice never tells me, I feel unhappy in this relationship. It just tells me, I will be, if I don't break-up. Maybe I want her to break up with me, so I don't have to face the consequences. That would actually relieve me. Ironic.   


Yet, I do not want to lose this girl, because I have never loved anybody so much like her. I just want to be happy with her once again, I just want to feel that joy, that I know, under this destructive thoughts, it's there. It feels like you lost your most precious treasure under in a quaggy, impassable swamp, so if you dare to submerge, you'll surely never see the light of the day again, not even to touch that treasure. But you have a picture of that treasure, and if you look at it, you'll jump in the swamp, without thinking. And this treasure is the heart of this girl, and the joy, and happiness, I feel, we feel, we've felt, when we were together. My girlfriend knows all about this, and she is very supportive about it. I think, she loves me at least as much, as I love her, and she is very proud of me, that I keep to persevere. Most of the time, these thoughts, this thorn never was present, when we were together. However, last time, it was, and this was the point, where I decided to seek help. I've found a psychiatrist earlier, although our therapy just started to become about this topic, because this never was the actual reason, I actually started the therapy with the doc. But last time, I told the doc about this, but one therapy occasion was far not enough for this. Our next session is far away in time, and on the other hand I think I could feel myself better, if I had knowledge, that there are others, who are feeling in the same, or in a similar way. I do not want, and I won't actually break-up, because that's the easiest way. I think, it would end my suffering. But if I do, I know, this problem is going to come up once again in my possible future relationships, not to mention, this girl is just beatuiful, majestic, supportive, and perfect for me. She supports me, I can evolve with her, and she is capable of making me a better person. There are little problems, but there is no relationship where there aren't.  


I actually tried to break up once with her, and she was aware of that. But then I've decided to keep fighting. But now, once again, I'm close to giving up. And that's why I have to fight with this thorn. For her, and myself. And this girl deserves to be fought for. But I don't know, how should I. And this is the part, where the community of Reddit comes in.  

- So, is there anyone out there, who feels the same, or at least, in a similar way?  
- If there is, how can you solve these problems? - How should I get over it?  
- What is your advice to me?  
- What is your guess, what is the problem with me? Is this some kind of anxiety? Or something else?  
- And where to start, to cure myself, so I can feel that happines once again, that I know, even now, there is deep within me?  
- Is it because the honeymoon phase is over?"

I personally am not scared to get sick given my age and mortality rate but if I were asymptomatic and gave it unknowingly to people in my household, I'd probably wish I continued to be cautious.
I only ever go outside for the recycling bins/mail, groceries and the occasional desire for local takeout.

I'd say 4/5 people I would see has a mask on, the few I haven't are bicyclists (almost none). When walking the direction toward someone without a mask I can't avoid, he/she/they typically don't notice me as I notice them until I cross the street/jaywalk to avoid them.

I got through that by keeping a diary, sleep schedule, getting up and reading every time I could sleep until I could, positive reinforcement type stuff, CBT.

My issue is that while those nightmarish times are gone, I still get flare ups that are mostly caused by things out of my control. For example, last night my dog ate stuff he wasn't supposed to outside and was throwing up all night and I didn't get any sleep. Whenever stuff like this happens, my thoughts and emotions immediately go to those horrible times I once had where I was a zombie every day.

338,bloodrein,Venting,3,Anxiety,1612983652,"I missed a second follow-up appointment with my physiatrist. I am embarrassed but also a little upset with the system. He's been patient. 

This is the second time I've missed an appointment. (Not in a row.)

These are very important, I have severe OCD.

After embarrassingly missing the last one, I had set a reminder on my phone. 

Of course, my phone was on silent. 

This has been me my entire life. I've missed appointments, got dates mixed up, ect. 

Part of me understands that it's my responsibility. But at the same time, part of me also understands that I've been unable to concentrate for a long time and this is part of that. 

The doctor isn't in the wrong here, he could've been serving other patients. He was good about the first miss. 

But I desperately want to tell him that it's not that this isn't important. That I appreciate his patience.  That I had made an attempt and still managed to mess it up. The days have been endless with the lock down. 

I had sent him an email but I feel a feeling in my throat because, like, he's a busy guy. Why send him a useless email? Who do I think I am? Lol.  But I also want him to know I sincerely regret my inactions. 

I'm also dreading his response to the email and his in-person call. I don't understand why I dread it. I've had a counselor get mad at me and threaten to discharge me when I was late before.

His secretary told me he had just called her when I had and that, if I do it one more time, he'll discharge me. I actually was OK with that and said ""understandable."" But I feel sick thinking about having to follow up and having him tell me in that stern tone that he'll have to discharge me. 

I get it. I'm careless. Selfish, even. Here these people have basically saved my life and I repay them by not making it a priority. That's why. There's no excuse. I just let the days go by. 

But this is a public health system.  I'm so lucky to have FREE care. So many do not. I feel such a pit in my stomach here. 

Anyway, I know you guys can't do much. I just needed to talk to people who maybe understand how distracted and sorry I am.

Thank you for listening if you had!"

Does anyone else have this sort of like anxiety and depression ‚Äúhangover‚Äù the next day or 2 after having a panic attack? Last night I had a panic attack because I kept having bad memories from when I was assaulted and this morning I woke up feeling like shit. I‚Äôm normally really good at preventing panic attacks when I notice the signs so this was my first panic attack in a long time. I think because it was the first in a long time, when I woke up feeling like shit I realized that this always happens after I get a panic attack. I have my panic attack and then even after having been calmed down I feel this lingering combination of anxiety, sadness, loneliness, and worthlessness and then physically I feel tired, sluggish, and either constantly hungry or not hungry in the slightest. Luckily (or rather not so luckily) this has happened enough times that I know how to recover but even still this ‚Äúhangover‚Äù can last from a day or 2 to a couple weeks so I was wondering if you do experience this how do you prevent and/ or recover from this ‚Äúhangover‚Äù?"

I'm feeling so much better than I was and I will always be around to help others in anyway I can. From my point of view it felt so good reading other people's stories and feeling like their words were my own.

I don‚Äôt think anyone who has never experienced a panic attack can understand how intense it is. this happened shortly before COVID happened.

i work about 17 miles from home and its a straight shot on one stretch of highway. The amount of time that it takes to get home can vary from 30 minutes up to 2 hours due to traffic so I would never know how long it would take to get home.   


one afternoon, I merged onto the highway into completely still traffic. I immediately felt stressed out. As the time ticked by just inching forward down the highway, I decided to try doing some breathing exercises. I did the 4-7-8 breathing technique probably for 15 minutes. I realize now you‚Äôre not supposed to breathe like that for more than a few reps at a time. It made me so lightheaded. My thoughts started racing wondering what would happen if I passed out while driving? Would it hurt other people at this speed? How long would it take for anyone to find me?   


At this point I decided to focus on breathing deeply, but I felt like I couldn‚Äôt get the air to go all the way into my body. I was breathing but I got no satisfaction from it. Then I told myself ok breathe normally and naturally, and it‚Äôs like I forgot how to breathe. I over analyzed each breath. Like the intuition on how to breathe which is like the most basic part of functioning went out the window.

I started noticing my hands were tingling and I tried like hitting them on the steering wheel to make them feel normal again but they kept tingling more. As the moments passed, my hands became completely numb. This is when the panic really peaked. I wondered if I was having a stroke. I was crying, hyperventilating, and totally couldn‚Äôt feel my hands. It lasted a lot longer than I‚Äôve heard panic attacks should last. But I kept my eyes on the road and focused on driving enough to get home.   


getting back in the car to go to work the next day was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. Any time I would see traffic pile up I would feel panic and that trapped feeling start rising up. Shortly after all this the holidays came and then COVID and work from home shortly after so I haven‚Äôt had to commute on the highway for almost a year. When we eventually go back to work I know I will continue to have to work on my anxiety about traffic."

Hi all, I‚Äôve recently been started on Paxil by my psychiatrist and it‚Äôs absolutely sent me down a deep dark hole of increased depression, increased anxiety and brought back my suicidal ideation.

I am trying to get into contact with my psychiatrist about getting off Paxil as a psychiatric nurse told me it‚Äôs a red flag that it‚Äôs brought my suicidal ideation back. I am safe but these thoughts are distressing.

I was really hoping it would provide me with some relief, as it is the 13th medication I have tried. I have reacted quite badly to some medications prescribed to me (amitriptyline, Abilify, venlafaxine, and now Paxil) and have noticed a little benefit in my depression (but no relief of generalized anxiety) from Zoloft, Celexa and Lexapro. I‚Äôve also been to a number of counsellors/therapists and have tried CBT, ACT, art therapy, and regular old talk therapy. I still have extremely distressing generalized anxiety.

I‚Äôm really starting to feel hopeless as it feels like I‚Äôm running out of things to try and the ones that my pharmacist is recommending are too expensive (I just finished university and now have no coverage - I live in Canada and we do not have coverage for pharmaceuticals.

I hope I find you in good health and mood.
I‚Äôm a 24 year old girl, who decided to change her life and kick the cigarette addiction. I‚Äôve smoked a pack a day for the last 2 years.

I am diagnosed with panic disorder and was put on benzos. However, I managed to get my anxiety under control (thank you therapy!) and two years ago I tapered off the meds as adviced by my doctor. However, this led to another addiction - cigarettes. I kind of replaced the meds with them, which was a huge mistake,
I know. 

I wanted to quit for a very long time, but was afraid that it will bring my anxiety back. 10 days ago I finally did it and I haven‚Äôt smoked a single cigarette since. 

Generally I feel fine and I don‚Äôt have any nicotine cravings. However, I definitely noticed that my anxiety got worse, especially during the first part of the day, when I used to smoke more. I feel restless and nervous without an apparent reason. My addicted brain is trying to convince me that this will be permanent. 

My question is to all ex-smokers here: how was your anxiety affected by quitting? How long did this elevation in anxiety last? In long term, how is your anxiety compared to when you were smoking?

Looking forward to any advice!"
392,h3rewego,Advice Needed,7,Anxiety,1612968022,"Should I have a consult with a therapist? First thing first, excuse me for my bad english!
I'll explain what's happening to me:

I have a group of friends that I used to chill out with, but a lot of times I got bored with them, plus they are not my type of people. I also have a girlfriend and other two close friends that I'm happy to see a lot.

Before covid I had a pretty normal life, I went to school, then gym and then chill at home or rarely see these friends or the other mates.

After covid, gyms and schools remained closed, and my days were empty and SOOOO boring, and I felt how important was for me the gym: because I care a lot about my health and my body, I used to go there 4 times per week for 2 hours, plus travel and a shower and I easily filled my afternoon. Then at evening I used to hang out with my girlfriend or just stay at home with her (I love watching Netflix and stuff).

My other group of friends that I got bored with tho, accuse me to not go out with them because of her (and also make fun of me), but it's really not true: I talked to some of them at school pre-covid, but rarely I hang out with them, and if I did so, it was just to not stay alone at home. Now i really don't want to hang out with them, because the last times that I did so, I got extremely bored.

The fact is that I get very anxious when they invite me to do anything, because really i'm afraid that they can make fun of me, but also I don't want to tell them that I get bored with them for the same reason.

I will see some of them in few days at school, and one of them everyday at work, and this thing is really making me anxious. I don't want to be made fun of, I just want to stay calm, talk normally with them but not about the fact that I don't hang out with them anymore.

That's not okay, is it? I'm just so stressed. Last year I loved school; now it's a rarity if I wake up wanting to stay awake and not go back to sleep for the sole reason not dealing with stress and anxiety.

I just realized I don't have an anxiety disorder; It was just trauma and me reacting to it by having anxiety when I am faced with the source of the trauma, which is almost 24/7. The source of the trauma is my family. They're all narcissistic psychopaths/sociopaths and that's not an overstatement they all are. I know how to deal with it but it is so difficult to get to that point because they are mostly in my mind and physically present which makes it even more difficult to rid myself of them while I'm forced to stay with them until I move out abroad in hopefully 1 or 2 years if I figure out how to. That means I have to deal with anxiety and childhood trauma head-on. I thought I had an anxiety disorder and was dealing with them at the same time but who knows maybe that could be the case; I don't have a therapist or someone to talk to to ensure me of my queries on the technicalities of anxiety and mental health in general."

literally if I‚Äôm walking down the street my brain tells me that I‚Äôm walking weird and that people are judging me, if I‚Äôm eating food like in public and I‚Äôm facing a lot of people my brain is going to tell me hey people are judging you because you look fucking ugly eating your food, or if I wear a certain outfit or do my hair a certain way I‚Äôve instantly change it because of my anxiety

Or literally out of nowhere like earlier today I was making some breakfast and I put some toast in the oven in my brain was like Bro you‚Äôre gonna die right now the fucking oven is gonna explode in your fucking face and you‚Äôre going to be in all little pieces
Lmao like what the hell 

And somehow I accept everything my brain is telling me and My gut does this turning thing and my body is accepting what it says

I can‚Äôt even go out with my friends because I‚Äôm literally sitting there thinking about what I should say, And overthinking the way that I‚Äôm positioning myself while I‚Äôm talking to them and idk if I come off weird or disrespectful 

I get a bottle of water from the fucking refrigerator and I‚Äôm getting anxiety over it somehow I‚Äôm just gonna blow up I just don‚Äôt know why my brain tells me that everything is gonna explode around me but apparently every fucking thing is gonna explode and I‚Äôm gonna die from a explosion that‚Äôs what my brain tells me all the time lmao 

Talking to people is so bad for me because I don‚Äôt know what to say like my responses that I give off are so nonchalant and boring..   

Some days I have super bad anxiety I wake up and I feel extremely anxious about literally nothing at all, and some days I‚Äôm fine, I mean I still have anxiety those days I‚Äôm fine but it‚Äôs not as bad 

So bad days outa good ones 
 5 outta 7 

I just wanna be able to do the simplest little task like brushing my teeth and taking a shower without worrying about me exploding or dying or such, I wouldn‚Äôt use the word in the envy but I people who can talk to literally anyone and spark up a conversation and not think about anything in that moment I wanna be like that I wanna be able to talk to people without thinking about what I‚Äôm saying and overthinking everything 

But that‚Äôs what anxiety does anxiety tells you the opposite of what reality really is

‚ÄúAnxiety is the biggest liar‚Äù like yeah I know but fuck it‚Äôs still so hard 

I haven‚Äôt even looked for a new job yet because of my anxiety and it really fucking sucks because honestly don‚Äôt like my job because of the employers and I just outgrew it but I can‚Äôt seem to change jobs for shit bc of my anxiety

430,Living_Bicycle_5103,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1615991681,"How to cope with fears 

These tips are for people who are coping with everyday fears. If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety-related condition, see our page on generalised anxiety disorder.

1. Take time out
It's impossible to think clearly when you're flooded with fear or anxiety. The first thing to do is take time out so you can physically calm down.

Distract yourself from the worry for 15 minutes by walking around the block, making a cup of tea or having a bath.

2. Breathe through panic
If you start to get a faster heartbeat or sweating palms, the best thing is not to fight it.

Stay where you are and simply feel the panic without trying to distract yourself. Place the palm of your hand on your stomach and breathe slowly and deeply.

The goal is to help the mind get used to coping with panic, which takes the fear of fear away.

Try this breathing technique for stress

3. Face your fears
Avoiding fears only makes them scarier. Whatever your fear, if you face it, it should start to fade. If you panic one day getting into a lift, for example, it's best to get back into a lift the next day.

4. Imagine the worst
Try imagining the worst thing that can happen ‚Äì perhaps it's panicking and having a heart attack. Then try to think yourself into having a heart attack. It's just not possible. The fear will run away the more you chase it.

5. Look at the evidence
It sometimes helps to challenge fearful thoughts. For example, if you're scared of getting trapped in a lift and suffocating, ask yourself if you have ever heard of this happening to someone. Ask yourself what you would say to a friend who had a similar fear.

6. Don't try to be perfect
Life is full of stresses, yet many of us feel that our lives must be perfect. Bad days and setbacks will always happen, and it's important to remember that life is messy.

7. Visualise a happy place
Take a moment to close your eyes and imagine a place of safety and calm. It could be a picture of you walking on a beautiful beach, or snuggled up in bed with the cat next to you, or a happy memory from childhood. Let the positive feelings soothe you until you feel more relaxed.

8. Talk about it
Sharing fears takes away a lot of their scariness. If you can't talk to a partner, friend or family member, call a helpline such as Breathing Space on 0800 83 85 87 or Samaritans on 116 123.

You could also try a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach over the telephone, with a service such as NHS Living Life. If you would like to find out more about this appointment-based service, you can visit the Living Life website or phone 0800 328 9655 (Mon to Fri, 1pm to 9pm).‚Äã

If your fears aren't going away, you can ask your GP for help. GPs can refer people for counselling, psychotherapy or help through an online mental health service, such as Living Life to the Full.

9. Go back to basics
Lots of people turn to alcohol or drugs to self-treat anxiety, but this will only make matters worse. Simple, everyday things like a good night's sleep, a wholesome meal and a walk are often the best cures for anxiety.

10. Reward yourself
Finally, give yourself a treat. When you've made that call you've been dreading, for example, reinforce your success by treating yourself to a massage, a country walk, a meal out, a book, a DVD, or whatever little gift makes you happy."

434,Living_Bicycle_5103,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1615990987,"Coping with panic attacks 





Panic attacks are sudden, intense surges of fear, panic, or anxiety. They are overwhelming, and they have physical as well as emotional symptoms.

Many people with panic attacks may have difficulty breathing, sweat profusely, tremble, and feel their hearts pounding.

Some people will also experience chest pain and a feeling of detachment from reality or themselves during a panic attack, so they may think they‚Äôre having a heart attack. Others have reported feeling like they are having a stroke.

Panic attacks can be scary and may hit you quickly. Here are 11 strategies you can use to try to stop a panic attack when you‚Äôre having one or when you feel one coming on:

1. Use deep breathing
While hyperventilating is a symptom of panic attacks that can increase fear, deep breathing can reduce symptoms of panic during an attack.

If you‚Äôre able to control your breathing, you‚Äôre less likely to experience the hyperventilating that can make other symptoms ‚Äî and the panic attack itself ‚Äî worse.

Focus on taking deep breaths in and out through your mouth, feeling the air slowly fill your chest and belly and then slowly leave them again. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a second, and then breathe out for a count of four:


2. Recognize that you‚Äôre having a panic attack
By recognizing that you‚Äôre having a panic attack instead of a heart attack, you can remind yourself that this is temporary, it will pass, and that you‚Äôre OK.

Take away the fear that you may be dying or that impending doom is looming, both symptoms of panic attacks. This can allow you to focus on other techniques to reduce your symptoms.

powered by Rubicon Project
3. Close your eyes
Some panic attacks come from triggers that overwhelm you. If you‚Äôre in a fast-paced environment with a lot of stimuli, this can feed your panic attack.

To reduce the stimuli, close your eyes during your panic attack. This can block out any extra stimuli and make it easier to focus on your breathing.


4. Practice mindfulness
Mindfulness can help ground you in the reality of what‚Äôs around you. Since panic attacks can cause a feeling of detachment or separation from reality, this can combat your panic attack as it‚Äôs approaching or actually happening.

Focus on the physical sensations you are familiar with, like digging your feet into the ground, or feeling the texture of your jeans on your hands. These specific sensations ground you firmly in reality and give you something objective to focus on.

5. Find a focus object
Some people find it helpful to find a single object to focus all of their attention on during a panic attack. Pick one object in clear sight and consciously note everything about it possible.

For example, you may notice how the hand on the clock jerks when it ticks, and that it‚Äôs slightly lopsided. Describe the patterns, color, shapes, and size of the object to yourself. Focus all of your energy on this object, and your panic symptoms may subside.


6. Use muscle relaxation techniques
Much like deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques can help stop your panic attack in its tracks by controlling your body‚Äôs response as much as possible.

Consciously relax one muscle at a time, starting with something simple like the fingers in your hand, and move your way up through your body.

Muscle relaxation techniques will be most effective when you‚Äôve practiced them beforehand.

7. Picture your happy place
What‚Äôs the most relaxing place in the world that you can think of? A sunny beach with gently rolling waves? A cabin in the mountains?

Picture yourself there, and try to focus on the details as much as possible. Imagine digging your toes into the warm sand, or smelling the sharp scent of pine trees.

This place should be quiet, calm, and relaxing ‚Äî no streets of New York or Hong Kong, no matter how much you love the cities in real life.


8. Engage in light exercise
Endorphins keep the blood pumping in exactly the right away. It can help flood our body with endorphins, which can improve our mood. Because you‚Äôre stressed, choose light exercise that‚Äôs gentle on the body, like walking or swimming.

The exception to this is if you‚Äôre hyperventilating or struggling to breathe. Do what you can to catch your breath first.

9. Keep lavender on hand
Lavender is known for being soothing and stress-relieving. It can help your body relax. If you know you‚Äôre prone to panic attacks, keep some lavender essential oil on hand and put some on your forearms when you experience a panic attack. Breathe in the scent.

You can also try drinking lavender or chamomile tea. Both are relaxing and soothing.

Lavender should not be combined with benzodiazepines. This combination can cause intense drowsiness.

10. Repeat a mantra internally
Repeating a mantra internally can be relaxing and reassuring, and it can give you something to grasp onto during a panic attack.

Whether it‚Äôs simply ‚ÄúThis too shall pass,‚Äù or a mantra that speaks to you personally, repeat it on loop in your head until you feel the panic attack start to subside.

11. Take benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines may help treat panic attacks if you take one as soon as you feel an attack coming on.

While other approaches to the treatment of panic may be preferential, the field of psychiatry has acknowledged that there is a handful of people who will neither respond fully (or at all in some cases) to the other approaches listed in above, and as such, will be dependent on pharmacological approaches to therapy.

These approaches often will include benzodiazepines, some of which carry FDA approval for the treatment of this condition, such as alprazolam (Xanax).

Because benzodiazepines are a prescription medication, you‚Äôll likely need a panic disorder diagnosis in order to have the medication on hand.

This medication can be highly addictive, and the body can adjust to it over time. It should only be used sparingly and in cases of extreme need."

446,LazyCock,Venting,0,Anxiety,1615985754,"Rant ahead. Triggers galore. Need a magic wand. M/46. One of the worst parts about my anxiety is that I retreat further and further into myself and withdraw from everyone. This really sucks, because the more I need the interaction, the further I pull myself away. Negative interactions make it worse, then I second-guess myself and pull away more.

This really magnified itself in the summer of 2019. My marriage came to a screeching halt, my mother succumbed to cancer, and I just fell to pieces. You don‚Äôt really understand what you have in place until the foundations buckle under your feet. I ended up in a new place, only seeing my daughter every other week. I tried hard to make it work, made visible progress, but I was shattered internally.  

Then the pandemic hit a few short months later.

Since the pandemic started, I ended up creating the smallest box possible to put myself in. Not having the solid work ritual of driving to, working, then driving home made my work suffer. Working from home had become the ultimate curse. Basic work items filled me with fear, and it shouldn‚Äôt be that way at all. It should be routine stepping stones, but it was akin to mountain after mountain.

Now I feel pressure all over. Pressure with work, family, friends, relationships, everything. I retreat further and further into the box. If it wasn‚Äôt for the relationship with my girlfriend, I think I might have ended up in a much worse spot with no way out.

There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that I need help and assistance. My problem is the antidepressants I‚Äôve tried seem to cause more disconnect and withdrawal. And with each different therapist I try, I feel like a fool. A lot of talking about the same things, new treatments based on the same concept. Running in place. Probably the worst thing about this is when I do try, I generate mistrust because the treatments fail. My body reacts strangely to most medicines in that I feel extreme fatigue with almost everything.

This is mental illness. And it‚Äôs just exhausting. I fear there is no real fix. And the way my brain overreacts and drains me of energy... I‚Äôm going to die a bit sooner than I was expecting. There will be a point where I just give up. I don‚Äôt want it to be like that. I want to go down swinging, not losing my mind in sorrow, constantly sensing the monsters around the corner."
447,depression_naps,Advice Needed,2,Anxiety,1615985125,"I think my anxiety is getting worse I was doing a lot better for the longest time but I think my anxiety is getting worse again. Every day something different sucks and it gives me constant anxiety. Like... Literally every damn day. How can I live in peace when every day something shitty happens and I fear doing anything at all more and more?? I know this is exaggerated and probably not-such-a-big-deal for most people... but every time something ""bad"" happens, my day is ruined and I just want to go to sleep or off myself. I go through a roller-coaster of emotions every day and every time something stresses me, I can't help but fantasize about shooting myself. Even tho I manage my depression okay-ish at this point... I just can't find any positivity nor stability in my life. At least not for long. And if I find it, it's gone by the next shitty thing that happens, because that always throws me off the wagon again. It's just an exhausting, never ending circle. I get anxious about everything! Making calls, going grocery shopping, driving, talking... sometimes I'm anxious about something that has already happened, even tho I know it makes no sense. Like, I just sit in my room and suddenly feel anxious about a job interview I had weeks ago?? Why?? 

There are a thousand examples how it ruins my day every time. Over and over again. I just can't stop this anxiety. It weights me down so much when I fck up again and again and fuels my anxious thoughts. I'm so embarrassed by all of my stupid mistakes that I make all the time. It makes me feel even more worthless and I worry all the time about everything already. There isn't a single day that I'm not completely stressed out about... Well my life. Most days I'm so stressed, I have a burning headache by the time I go to bed. Sometimes it stays for days non-stop. Which stresses me out even more... 

I know there is no reason to be stressed constantly and I already talked to my therapist about it... But none of the relaxation techniques seem to be working so I always end up coping in... bad ways. Which stresses AGAIN because it makes me feel like a failure. Is all of this a symptom of my depression?? Or is it just my personality? I wasn't always like this, it kinda ""developed"" in the last  3 years or so and got gradually worse during the last few months. By now I'm a complete fck up, I mess up appointments, I do so many things wrong (even simple things, that I've done 1000 times before), forget important stuff, mess up appointments and feel overwhelmed by everything that is going on - while beeing anxious and embarrassed about myself 24/7. I just want to chill one day and not... be. Not be stressed about my life, my future, everything. Not be anxious about going for a walk or calling a friend. I don't want to live this life, MY LIFE like this, everything sucks and I fail miserably at it. 

Any advice?? I know this text is really long, I apologize."

So, I‚Äôm a 15 year old girl, and I suddenly got a fear that I would turn into a pedophile somehow (despite being disgusted by the thought of children like that, immediately turned off whenever I got a thought of them like that my entire life up until now.),, i have ocd and once I feared I was a cannibal, another time I feared I was gay, (all of which I ended up not being) but now it turned into fear of turning into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I am one now, because just ew. But I‚Äôm terrified of turning into one

So I was having anxiety over it today and I had a compulsion. Once I read a story of a guy who looked at shota which is like anime drawings of boys who are young teens or pre teens i think and said he wished he never got into that stuff because maybe he wouldn‚Äôt be a pedo then. And I got so scared that if I saw shota I would be attracted and turn into a pedophile. So I had a compulsion to look at a picture of a shota (this seems counterintuitive and it is, but that‚Äôs what my compulsions are like. When I had religious ocd that god would do something bad to me I had compulsions to search up people who had bad experiences with God because my whacked brain thought somehow that would soothe my ocd which it only made it worse. I felt like I HAD to search up these experiences and read them because if I didn‚Äôt idk I just had to and I hated it)

Looking at it immediately it just grossed me out. It wasn‚Äôt porn or anything, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stomach looking at that. It was of a boy maybe 12? I‚Äôm 15, so that‚Äôs a 3 year difference but still it was an anime drawing so they could‚Äôve been younger or older I don‚Äôt know. I had a fear that I would find attraction to it, and though i guess a 3 year age difference wouldn‚Äôt be the worst, my fear is that I‚Äôll be attracted to it and then when I age, the age I‚Äôm attracted to wont age if that makes sense. Because I read stories of pedophiles where that happened to them.

they were wearing clothes but the picture was sort of in like that ‚Äúinnocent but sexual implications‚Äù manner, that in itself made me uncomfy but my ocd kept telling me I could be attracted and so I was really focusing on my groin area to see if I felt anything/felt attracted because I was utterly terrified that I would get turned on by it and turn into a pedophile. I don‚Äôt think I felt turned on, more uneasy and anxious. But this is the worst part, but I felt like I had to do it to make sure I wasn‚Äôt attracted and I could stop worrying about it. I want to kill myself because of it and I just want to throw up and I can‚Äôt believe I even tried it but I attempted to touch myself to see if it felt pleasurable or uncomfortable, and I felt uncomfortable. After like 3 seconds I had to stop because I just couldn‚Äôt stomach it and Felt so grossed out that they looked young and it was a child and just gross. 

But it‚Äôs the fact that I even looked that up, the fact that I even did that I haven‚Äôt been able to eat all morning because my appetite is gone and I feel like the worst person ever and that I am a pedophile. I‚Äôm scared I want to kill myself and I probably will because I‚Äôm to scared to live and see if I turn out to be a pedophile. I‚Äôm so so sorry for even doing that and it was so wrong and I feel like puking. I hate my compulsions because I feel like I have to do them to make sure I‚Äôm not what I‚Äôm scared of being. I don‚Äôt know what to do I had to get this off my chest somewhere I‚Äôm really sorry. I‚Äôm really horrible I‚Äôm sorry

I know the comments will either be to see a therapist or maybe to die because of what i did which I wouldn‚Äôt blame them for saying that, but I can‚Äôt tell my therapist this I can‚Äôt tell anyone this."

After around a week, i just read on Twitter that there are a quiet a lot of cases where repairmen took a look of client's phone. Some of them even without consent, upload people's private media on Twitter. In the country where I live in (Indonesia), there are a lot of private VIP Telegram group that you have to pay in order to get in where it has so many nonconsensual images and porn.

I'm so paranoid that the repairman i went to might be one of those evil people. But it has been 4 months since i got my phone repaired, i have done a lot of reverse searches of my face and photos on the Internet, followed so many Indonesian porn accounts i can find on Twitter, there hasnt (and hopefully not) any of my private photos online. I also check popular porn sites every single day and i dont see me there, fortunately.

Earlier this week I arranged to see one of best friends for a walk around the local nature reserve. I have pretty much hidden away during the pandemic so I feel anxious being around people again. 

I was a little bit anxious about meeting up this morning but relaxed a bit when we started walking around and chatting. 

I have always had a phobia of heights and as we approached a bridge above a road I could feel a panic attack coming on. I almost had to make up an excuse and turn around and it took every inch of strength in my body to get over that bridge. 

Has anybody else experienced a random panic attack like that before? 

I know that I should probably be looking at this like a win that I faced my fear - and then walked back over the bridge again, which wasn't as bad as the first time. But it has scared me a bit as it obviously wasn't a nice experience and feels like a big setback in the progress I have made recently."

456,kingtrifecta,Venting,1,Anxiety,1615981217,"Tired of going to work because I have to pretend to be a person I work at one of my local retail stores. 

We are a big store with a lot of customers and I have a decent amount of other coworkers. 

The first few months I was working here my anxiety was under control. It was also a breath of fresh air because before I started working here I did nothing but stay in my house and quarantine. 

Which I guess it was fine when you think about it in a health way but my mental health was rotting away. I felt like I didn‚Äôt even know who I was anymore. And I don‚Äôt mean that in a metaphorical way. I legit was dissociating completely and I had no grasp on reality. Time was an illusion because everyday felt the same. I just slowly lost myself. 

However when I got the job my mental health WAS going back to a good place. Especially since I had nothing else to do (I dropped college until this pandemic gets a little bit more under control). I was making friends with my coworkers, loved my managers, loved the customers and location. 

But that was a short lived feeling. I‚Äôm still not in school so that sort of ‚Äúuseless‚Äù feeling still simmers in my stomach everyday. I still haven‚Äôt talked to some family that I know and love in a very long time. My social life still sucks. 

But my anxiety came back and now I feel like I have to force myself to be a person. Which is ironic because a few months back I was complaining how I wanted to be a person. 

People come up to me and say hi and expect me to be all bubbly and happy. When I‚Äôm in the break room people start talking to me like I‚Äôm going to be this funny and flamboyant gay person. I‚Äôm not that person I was anymore when I got hired the first time three months ago. Im just this fake that‚Äôs always depressed. Meds and therapy make me feel less overwhelmed but I still don‚Äôt feel the same. 

Positives; I make a lot of money, have broken a record at how long I can hold a job, social interaction. 

Cons: feel burnout, back issues, anxiety has become worse. 

Overall I think the cons and positives balance each other out but pretending to be a person is still such a bitch. 

I hate having focus problems when I‚Äôm having anxiety I hate not knowing what to say or feeling a mental block. When that anxiety is gone everything comes so naturally to me. I‚Äôm mad."

463,sharkpickles, ,3,Anxiety,1615978859,"Wellbutrin changed my wife into a new person. about 7 months ago, my wife started taking Wellbutrin 150 once per day for her own panic/anxiety problem, which was mostly caused by sexual trauma in her childhood. she was having near-constant anxiety and avoidance problems. she was basically a nervous wreck almost all the time.

after 2-3 weeks of feeling insane during the adjustment, she leveled out and started experiencing drastic life changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

it was truly unbelievable. she went from being scared, closed-off, anxious, defensive, and avoidant to being strong, confident, self-assured, and a lot more openly loving and empathic. 

the change was crazy. or rather...*not crazy.*

she wasn't even in therapy at the time (she'd been doing CBT for 2 years prior to taking Wellbutrin, but she'd stopped several months prior, because it didn't seem to help her).

craziest of all? she used to be avoidant, defensive, and dismissive of sex. she avoided it at all costs, except on very rare occasions. according to her, she ""had sexual anxiety 90-95% of the time, all the time"". she could barely talk about it, let alone do it.

she had a strong sexual phobia.

now she says ""i don't have sexual anxiety 90-95% of the time"", and it shows. it's like some switch got flipped. 

it's like she never had a sexual phobia at all. she used to get panic attacks before, during, or after sex pretty often. now it never, ever happens.

in fact, she enjoys and craves sex like never before. we've been together 20 years now, and i've never seen her like this.

it's like the past 19 years never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

she's like a whole different person. she's calm, confident, and just has a ""quieter"" mind. she never has sleeping problems anymore, she doesn't get nervous about work, and she openly and confidently discusses her views and ideas without any hemming or hawing.

she's so affectionate, caring, and giving. she handles stressful situations with a ""fuck it"" attitude. ""fuck it, why worry? it'll succeed or fail, but things will be ok either way.""

she's also become very accepting of personal insignificance. ""i'm nothing and nobody, and i don't give a damn. i'm happy to just be me. i don't have to prove anything to anyone. i care about doing my job and having fun with the people i love, and if anyone disapproves, then fuck them.""

&amp;#x200B;

it's like she experienced some kind of ego death. she no longer worries about mortality or the future. she no longer gives any care about existential concepts like life and death. she no longer cares at all about ""her place in the world"". 

and after 11 years, she's no longer in mourning about her mother's suicide. of course she's sad about it and misses her, but she doesn't stress or ruminate about it. now she's ""happy for the time we had together"".

it's like something shut off the part of her brain that cares about ""big ideas"" and ""big problems"". mostly, her life seems centered on little things, like work issues and where to get brunch, wanting to sleep late and trying to get the laundry done before Saturday night.

it's like she's ""living for now"" instead of living in the past, or living in some scary, uncertain future.

&amp;#x200B;

when i try discussing things that make me nervous, scared, or worried, especially if they're ""big deals"" like death, illness, or ""our place in the world"", she just grins and says ""it's not worth worrying about. we have a lot to do in life, so what's the use in clogging up our brains with crap?""

i envy this attitude. 

&amp;#x200B;

don't get me wrong--she's always happy to listen to me and offer sympathy and empathy, but it's almost like she doesn't remember being constantly anxious and worried. almost like it happened to someone else, instead of her. 

i'm jealous as hell, and i'm so happy she's no longer troubled. 

&amp;#x200B;

she seems capable and content to live in the moment instead of anxiously trying to imagine all possible outcomes. she has a ""well, let's just wait and see"" attitude. she doesn't ruminate. she doesn't ideate. she doesn't have crazy worries about tomorrow. she doesn't toss and turn in bed. 

in 5 minutes she's out and snoring, and she doesn't get night terrors anymore. she sleeps like a log.

&amp;#x200B;

she hasn't had a panic attack since the 4th week of taking Wellbutrin--so about 6, 7 months now. she says she gets occasional ""anxiety flutters"", but that they're very easy to blow off and brush away. she says she ""just thinks about something else"" or distracts herself for a minute, and it passes without becoming an attack.

she's much less stressed and angry. she no longer has burning career ambition, which she celebrates, because ""all that matters is feeling good and enjoying life"". she doesn't care whether she gets promoted in the near future, because she's ""happy right where i am. if i get promoted, cool--if not, i'll still be ok in this role.""

&amp;#x200B;

i want to be like her. god *damn*, how i want to be like her.

is this reaction typical of people taking Wellbutrin? 

&amp;#x200B;

i've been picking her brain trying to learn her methods, and she says this is what she does/feels in contrast to her previous self:

&amp;#x200B;

\- we're all gonna die. i don't care. i just care about doing my job, having fun, and relaxing. 

\- i started fighting my anxiety. i started yelling at it, taunting it, and challenging it. i fought back against the bully. i dared it to hurt me. i called it a pussy and a coward and a piece of shit, and i hoped and prayed for it to end my life. but it didn't, because it can't. when i did that often enough, my brain seemed to learn that anxiety was a useless, pointless waste of energy...and most of my anxiety problems stopped in a few months and haven't come back.

\- everyone on earth needs some type of fidget spinner. i watch TV and play phone games to distract myself, and i don't care if that bothers people. it's a tool that helps me, so i'm going to do it. i'm also weaning off FB, playing mindless phone games instead of caring what random social media idiots think.

\- i always fall asleep with the TV on because it blocks my ""brain chatter"". i'm going to do this the rest of my life, and i don't feel bad about it. it's soothing and i like the way it feels.

\- i plan on taking Wellbutrin the rest of my life because it helps me feel better. i'd rather feel better with a pill than struggle without one, and that doesn't bother me at all. fuck anyone who has a problem with that.

\- most of people's problems and anxieties come from selfishness and ego. drop the ego, stop thinking you're more important than you really are, kick your anxiety in the balls every time it starts happening, and you'll feel better. the world isn't waiting breathlessly for your ""amazing contributions"". you aren't depriving anyone of your unique, special self. when we die, 99.999% of people won't give the slightest shit. you're just depriving YOU of an amazing life by worrying that you're ""wasting your life"". most people waste their lives, and they're happy anyway. better off wasting your life than living with constant stress and anxiety that you aren't ""good enough"".

\- why stress? have fun, play video games, sleep late, waste time with your friends, go out to dinner, eat cheesecake, lie around in your pajamas, and do whatever else feels good to you. we'll all be dead soon, so who cares? the only possible difference between you and some health guru is 10 extra years of life--maybe--and i'd rather die at 75 than live to 85 as a vegetable in a nursing home. you'll both end up dead sooner or later, so do what feels good to you. life's too short to worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

is this the expected/intended outcome of Wellbutrin?

my doctor says Wellbutrin isn't good for treating panic, anxiety, or phobias. yet my dear wife seems to have experienced an almost religious or spiritual change these days. 

it's like something ""clicked"" in her brain, and she isn't even in therapy.

i want this for myself. i need this for myself, and i'm very hesitant to try SSRIs because of all the unwanted side effects.

her first 2 weeks were a wild ride--ups and downs, agitation, grimacing, poor sleep, vivid dreams, muscle tension, increased anxiety.

then around the middle of the 3rd or 4th week, it stopped pretty suddenly. she got up, she made a pile of eggs and bacon and a pot of coffee. 

i said ""how are you feeling today?"" and she said ""i pretty much feel fine."" and that was that. 

no further side effects. it's like everything just stopped, except for the positive feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

What are healthy ways I can work through my anxiety without overwhelming my girlfriend or placing an unnecessary emotional burden on her? Also, is there any way I can help her to better understand the way that I feel when I am anxious?  I do not want to be taxing for her mental health, and I don't want to be constantly causing issues on the basis of my irrational fears.   Any help is appreciated!"
465,sharkpickles,Medication,1,Anxiety,1615978221,"Wellbutrin/buspar...hit or miss? hi, i'm a 40/M, and recently i've reached a crossroads.

this post is lengthy, but please bear with me. i need *your* advice. 

please feel free to skip over the background and skim down to ""question"" if you like.

&amp;#x200B;

***Background:***

my anxiety is so severe that i can hardly leave the house anymore. some days it's a huge struggle to swallow food. even showering can be a big struggle lately.

my anxiety is rooted in emetophobia--the constant fear that something will make me sick. it can be any number of things, from standing too long, to taking a too-hot shower, to riding in a car, to a panic attack caused by a huge number of things (though i've never gotten sick from a panic attack, i'm afraid it'll happen ""someday"").

i don't eat very much, which gives me hunger pain--often triggering anxiety. then i'll eat something, and boom, the rumblings and stirrings will trigger anxiety because i think ""i waited too long, now eating is going to make me sick"". 

i've become agoraphobic, but even staying inside all day doesn't relieve my problems.

i'm also taxing the hell out of my wife. she's literally the only factor that helps me stay level and stable. 

nighttime is the worst. she's home working during the day, so that helps...and over the past few weeks, she's been staying up until 2-3 AM with me, sometimes watching calming TV shows, other times just chatting.

the weird thing is, a lot of the time i'm pretty lucid during anxiety attacks. i'll tell myself--or say aloud--""this can't hurt me. i've experienced this thousands of times, and i was always ok afterwards. just let it go."" sometimes i'm actually more annoyed than scared.

i've also been having bad nightmares and waking up sweating and scared.

i seriously need a tooth extraction, and it's causing me pain. but i'm too terrified to leave the house for an appointment, let alone get into the office--or the chair. 

something needs to change. life can't continue like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***question:***

my wife has had amazing wins with Wellbutrin (i'm going to write another post in this subreddit about that, right after this one), helping her deal with her own obsessiveness, panic, anxiety, and avoidance.

it had an incredible, almost unbelievable effect on her. after 7 months on Wellbutrin, she's like a new person. it's absolutely unreal. 

&amp;#x200B;

other people sing the praises of BuSpar, but i'm not really convinced.

my doctor isn't so sure about giving me Wellbutrin, saying it can cause anxiety and it ""isn't intended to treat panic, anxiety disorders, or phobias"". 

yet my wife is doing SO much better on Wellbutrin 150 once per day. she's become a pretty chill, confident person who doesn't really worry about the future anymore. she sleeps like a log and doesn't struggle with self-esteem, guilt, or worries that she's ""losing her mind"". no more intrusive thoughts. she still distracts herself from unwanted thoughts, but it's no longer a struggle.

she was having panic attacks 1-2 times a week before the meds, even when she was in CBT. after adjusting to the meds, and now 7 months later, she hasn't had ONE panic attack. 

not one.

&amp;#x200B;

the thing is, long ago i took Prozac, and i felt like complete hell. no libido, i was brain foggy and physically weak, and i couldn't concentrate. after 4 months i ended up losing my job because of it. i literally felt like i was losing my mind. i didn't know who or where i was anymore.  

i don't think my body agrees with SSRIs  =/   

that's why i'm curious about BuSpar and Wellbutrin. 

&amp;#x200B;

i'm also very scared of side effects. anything that causes nausea or dizziness is terrifying to me, and it seems like these two don't really feature those side effects prominently.

my doctor discussed a beta-blocker like atenolol, but my resting heart rate is 80ish (normal), and he's concerned my blood pressure will get too low. 

plus, taking BBs long-term can cause physical problems like dizziness, heat intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, and exercise intolerance (you can throw up if you exert yourself a little too hard, even by moving furniture), so i'm not convinced that beta-blockers will work for me. i doubt they'd help my phobia and intrusive thoughts anyway.

i take the occasional Xanax, but obvi, that isn't a daily/long-term solution. getting addicted to Xanax? going through withdrawal? yeah, no. 

&amp;#x200B;

please share any thoughts or ideas you have. i'm getting into a desperate situation here.

&amp;#x200B;

thank you, and be well."
466,RepresentativeNo3605, ,0,Anxiety,1615977722,"No anxiety you WILL NOT win I‚Äôm feeling pretty damn good right now. I had a huge anxiety attack on Friday which left me feeling surreal, scared, disconnected. 

My already very paranoid personality was causing my anxiety to be literally 24/7. I felt I was going to feel that weird forever, I felt void of all my emotions, I was scared I had developed an anxiety disorder because it was so constant.

Yesterday I said to myself you will NOT win, I will win this battle or go down fucking fighting. For the first time since the ordeal on Friday (since last night) my anxiety is under my control, it‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm not going to dwell on how weird I feel emotionally, who cares? Let time take its toll, I already feel better; for the first time in days I felt happiness, I‚Äôve just been dancing in the shower to my favourite songs, yes those feelings of the future are coming back, yes I will get married to that girl, yes I will go to those festivals, yes I will go on holiday. I‚Äôm not going to feed these horrible feelings with my anxiety, I‚Äôm just going to go with the flow until I feel normal and I feel better already.

This is a mental battle guys, we‚Äôve ALL got this, your anxiety is lying to you and it IS so possible to take back control."

468,lellowyedbetter,Share Your Victories,0,Anxiety,1615976403,"Thanks for helping me take a step Hope you‚Äôre all well today. 

Wanted to share something that works for me in the hope the it might encourage or help someone similar. 

The root of my anxiety is very much contained in my family. Their lives, choices etc. etc and sometimes my guilt for succeeding and leaving them behind/not spending as much time. Though, for context, we‚Äôre not a close family, and it‚Äôs not something I long for. 

A lot of my anxiety can be classed as worry, I suppose. There are valid-ish reasons for feeling this way. Often meaning there‚Äôs no real way to solve it. I can‚Äôt control their lives just to satiate my anxieties. 

I cope by ignoring it. I don‚Äôt check up; actively don‚Äôt look at when they were last online, don‚Äôt text, don‚Äôt call and palm off invitations to hang out. This isn‚Äôt ideal but the idea of confronting them with my concerns make me feel worse, and a little bit stupid...

Recently I accepted that this was going to be a part of my life whether I ignore it or not, so I took what I thought was a HUGE leap and spoke to them all about my distancing and feelings etc. 

It didn‚Äôt cure my anxiety, but it immediately became more manageable. Today I felt the impulse to ignore contacting them again when it the anxiety began to spike, so I sent a message to my mother and explained that to her.  It helped. I feel more normal than I have done in months. 

This is a long way to say something small which is - try interacting with the cause of your anxiety (if you‚Äôre aware of it). 

It‚Äôs likely obvious to all you folks but it feels like a win to me as I had never looked for help and advice prior to this (only joined this sub a week or two ago). 

So thanks to all of you for sharing concerns, worries and tips with each other because it inspired me to take a step in the right direction. This is not what I want from life and think this has taught me that my way out is small, brave, manageable goals and repeated examples of the outcome ‚Äúnot being that bad‚Äù."
469,lead-th3-way,Work/School,3,Anxiety,1615976320,"Having second thoughts Just recently I've decided to finally do something major in my life for a change (hopefully for the better) and try to get back into studies to pursue my dream career. I intend to pursue art and have been a half self-taught artist (apart from like 3 short term art classes I took)

But now I'm starting to have second thoughts about it.

It's mostly what if my skills still aren't great when I graduate? What if I end up not being as good? Or if I'm actually not cut out to do art at all? And because of all those I'll end up wasting my parents' money because they are willing to help me to get back to school.

Initially I was pretty excited when I went down to spoke with the school about the course, like looking at the works they've shown me for me I just instantly go ""This is what I want to do and what I want to work towards"".

I'm not a self-confident person at all and get really critical about myself on the things that I like. What brought on this change was me looking at my past experiences and thinking that I'm just not able to do an office job for the rest of my life.

I want to be excited but at the same time I'm also worried about being excited."
470,RepresentativeNo3605,DAE Questions,0,Anxiety,1615976103,"Does anyone‚Äôs anxiety make them feel... weird? Hey guys. I‚Äôve never really struggled with anxiety because it‚Äôs always felt like something I could control; I‚Äôve always been an over thinker and worrier but I guess that would be pretty normal.

I‚Äôm a uni student and over the past 4 months I‚Äôve had time to reflect on how bad I was living. I hadn‚Äôt eaten fruit or vegetables in that time, I was eating a meal a day (usually McDonald‚Äôs or another takeaway) I was drinking no water, no vitamins, and I was constantly staying awake for uni.

Well, who knew that would take a toll? On Friday I had a terrible anxiety build up which made me feel very surreal. Because I was always a worrier I have constantly been thinking about it and scared I would be in that state of mind forever. I had to come home the next day and since then (until yesterday) I had CONSTANT anxiety because I felt so weird. 

Well, thankfully, I now know it‚Äôs not GAD or any anxiety disorder because I calmed down, deal with how I usually deal with anxiety, accepted it and my anxiety went away. It‚Äôs been spiking a tiny bit but I feel it‚Äôs under control, and I haven‚Äôt had constant anxiety since yesterday. 

The question is, would that constant state of anxiety do that? Is it common? I want to hear others experience, it was so frightening because I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, it‚Äôs like I felt so lost, so scared I‚Äôd be like that forever; the feeling was kind of like being disconnected except with your emotions, like things that usually make you happy / look forward to just didn‚Äôt feel right - nothing did. 

I still somewhat feel like that but I‚Äôm not going to worry. It‚Äôll pass, I have my anxiety under control and I feel so much better. I‚Äôm not going to get scared or worry and feed it, I‚Äôll just let time do it‚Äôs thing."

I am a long time anxiety sufferer, and I kind of have an unhealthy 'grin and bear it' attitude at least concerning myself (except when I had postpartum anxiety and desperately needed counseling and medication). 

My husband recently went to the doctor for the first time in a while and was told he has high blood pressure and to change his habits (less drinking, start exercising, nothing crazy). He went full panic mode and dove headfirst into an intense diet. Started exercising every day from nothing. After a week of straight spinach and salads and stuff, he had a bad stomach day. This triggered a bunch of health anxiety. Checking every twinge, testing blood pressure multiple times a day, even checking heart rate. He has never felt this kind of anxiety before - like I am sure many of you have, where it eats at you all day and you don't feel in control of your thoughts and you cannot stop it. 

With the combo of reading him helpful posts from the health anxiety subreddit, constantly being there for him to talk to and be reassuring, and being able to relate as I have felt the crushing anxiety over all sorts of things (including health) for half of my life...I feel like I've been helping. He had a good day today keeping his health anxiety at bay. 

But tonight he could not fall asleep due to anxiety, and came down out of his mind anxious. He said he has no idea why he is anxious - he's anxious about being anxious. Anxious about the anxiety he might feel. I tried my best to help and hug him and talk him down. 

This is so unlike him (and I'm sure that's part of the reason he feels anxious - it's like, I've never been anxious like this before so there must be something wrong with me). We both feel a bit of anxiety because we don't have health insurance until May. That means no doctors, no therapy, no reassurance about health issues, no ability to get medication etc. I just found out I'm pregnant yesterday and I am dealing with my own anxiety related to that especially after the last pregnancy ended in miscarriage (and I won't be able to see my doctor until almost the second trimester thanks to the insurance), and I feel exhausted trying to fix this and cope with this.

I had another dream where I was with my abusive ex girlfriend, and I couldn‚Äôt escape her, and she was everywhere I turned trying to confront me about stopping porn, as she found my phone and reddit account. It felt scarily real, like I was never able to get away from her to begin with and I was still with her.


A dream I‚Äôve had many times over is me in different high-up places and I have a terrible fear of heights, and it seems like they are always in different settings, but they always end up with me being on a slim, unstable platform or ledge of some sort that happens to always crumble, or I‚Äôll be in some kind of huge mall with slim catwalks and walkways that horrify me.

I am mainly saying all of this to ask if anyone else has had similar feelings or issues who have been affected as well, I always put on a smiling face for the crowd when I go out but when I am alone, I constantly want to cry because I can‚Äôt feel anything on the inside now. I just want it all to go away. I took feeling normal for granted, now I don‚Äôt remember what it feels like to feel normal on the inside."

I can't even point one thing that's making me anxious there are so many. It sucks that my therapist cancelled a meeting that's a week before national holiday so I don't have therapy for 2 weeks. I don't even know what makes me so anxious... Is it my relationship, is it my school... Is it myself? Probably all. And now I am anxious also because I think I irritate my therapist. Oh and obviously all my friends have birthdays at the same time (right now) and I don't have enough energy to get everyone a present but if I don't I'm gonna be a bad friend. Also my boyfriend asked to move in with him and I think it's a little too early but I haven't told him this yet. And I just feel so insecure on every level of my life. I tryna not be a perfect person but its scarry - I don't want to hurt anybody. Also I lately agreed to be head's assistant at our students club but I think that's the least of my worries. I can't talk about this to anyone other than my therapist because I'm afraid no one gots the patience to listen to my stuff, especially when I can't find a word in my native language. What should I do to survive till 10th May? Because I've already started doing things I don't want to be doing like refusing to breath. I needed to vent but also any advice would be grateful.

503,DirectorMoltar,Venting,2,Anxiety,1619301381,"bridges burned. not sure how to come back from this.  on Thursday evening I was on a voice chat with my best friend from middle school. we chat several times a week usually. he moved to DC a few years ago and since then I've really struggled to have friends, but knowing I had this person always maintained the idea that I did have friends, they were just elsewhere. Well on voice chat he tells me ""oh yeah, i'll be in town tomorrow. mutual friend is coming."" i was trying to mask my anxiety spike but just said incredulously ""really? why didn't you tell me?"" and he said ""we aren't coming there specifically to see you."" his roommate heard him talking to me and said ""YOU DIDNT TELL HIM WE WERE COMING?? WHY?"" and he responds ""uh just didn't think to haha"". 

that really cut deep. I told him I would talk to him later and got off the call and collapsed into bed and cried. I didn't understand how I could be forgotten and left out like that. no respect to anything I might have going on, or any time to prepare. furthermore he is acutely aware of my anxiety and that this was likely triggering. 

I sent him a message later that night that told him I was hurt he didn't tell me he was coming into town. He began typing but ultimately ignored it. This coinciding with the death anniversary of a close friend, my relentless benzodiazepene taper and my poor judgement led me to go on the offensive. i'm not making excuses for it, I said some mean things and went too far when I told him not to contact me. 
Instead I get all these messages from his girlfriend acting like she is oblivious to the situation trying to clean up his mess. id been up all night contemplating you know what and could not deal with her bullshitting me even if it was with good intention and i just snapped at her as well.

my friend finally messaged me towards the end of the day. he explained he ignored me because x y and z, and then he ignored me further because he thought we would just hang out, and basically how i've shamed him, said the meanest things ever said to him, and to get over myself and stop blaming shit on him. he is not sorry. 

I just left that one. I don't know what else to do. i'm alone here in my house all weekend. my friends are in the same place as me for once but i'm not seeing them. what the fuck is wrong with me? i hurt so badly. i'm not even sure i logically understand my anger from point to point. its just hell. its hell. at one point they pulled up to my moms house and started sending me pics of it on discord. I was in bed for two days, unshowered. no one bothered to tell me they were coming. I got so upset i bricked my iPhone by throwing it against my wall like a child. i'm 25 and a virgin whose never even held hands with a girl and lives with my mom. its kind of impressive i was able to keep a friend this long. it's hard to look down the barrel of this klonopin taper and feel like it's even possible, let alone worthwhile. 

I deserve this, ultimately. that is what is so hard to deal with. I could have taken the one day notice and met up with them but for some reason I decided to self destruct. i am so ashamed of my behavior i don't think I can face any of them ever again. it's difficult to accept this. 

I just needed to vent. thank you. 

tl;dr friends come into town and don't tell me. i get extremely triggered by this and a lack of communication and feel so slighted I refuse to hang out w them when they come into town. best friend from middle school isn't sorry at all and doesn't want anything more to do with me. i've been a dick to basically everyone that's come down for this trip at some point and will not see any of my friends and they likely don't want to see me."

Whilst all my peers were out drinking in fields, having boyfriends and girlfriends, and getting jobs for the first time, learning to drive. I barely left my room.

 The idea of driving a car terrifies me, and even if it didn't in order to learn I have to sit in a confined space one on one with a stranger.

I've never so much as had a crush, let alone kiss anyone and definitely not anything more. Sometimes I think maybe I'm ace. But Its not like I dont find the odd celebrity attractive or wish I was a character in a book  as pathetic as I know it is.

 But I dont ever see myself being in a relationship, im a very boring person so what would I even talk about with a person, I can't talk to people. Boys especially scare me almost, which isn't exactly helpful as a straight girl. 

I have 2 years left of uni, which means I need a job afterwards and even just the thought of looking for a part time job fills me with anxiety and that's not even looking for a job it's just me thinking of doing it. Any job means social interaction and I can't do that, it means going through yet another phase of uncertainty before things settle into a routine and I can't cope with that.

To be honest I just can't picture the future, growing up I always knew what I would do in the next stage of school, I'd decided on my Alevels before I had even sat my GCSEs and always knew I was going to uni. But now I just cannot picture a future. 

And I say this not suicidal or depressed but as a fact, i wouldn't be surprised if i didn't make it past 30, and that is fucking unsettling.

So yeah, sometimes i just wish i could go to sleep and wake up one day in my forties with a husband and kids and secure job. It's like I want someone else to live the next few (10 or 20) years."

I became inspired from a [brief video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NgtEfg3vJk) on Tim Ferris' youtube page about how he uses his phone, so it doesn't control him.

I deleted Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, Bumble, Chess, Chrome, Gmail from my phone and I placed my charger downstairs so when I go to bed I put my phone on the charger away from my bed. 

After about a day of doing this, I immediately feel less ""I need to check my phone"" and I'm becoming aware of how long it's been since I've felt like this. To just be somewhere and not have my phone on my mind constantly!

Like, I want to let go of a worry, but then I begin to worry that if I don't worry about it, that I'm making a big mistake. I mean, being worried in some situations is good and necessary even. So I never know when I need to let go of something or not.

For instance, money problems/paying for bills is an example of a ""bigger"" thing. It's not an urgent matter, but it's always in the back of my mind. So when I worry that I spent too much money on something, I can't tell if I should let it go or not."
509,crinmakesstuff,Recovery Story,2,Anxiety,1619298404,"From Wreck to Riches I'm hoping this will be received in the way it is intended which is to share a bit about my background and a product I have created recently based on my 20+ year battle with GAD.

I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and specific health anxiety disorder when I was 20. I'm now 39. At first I thought my world had ended because it all came on very quickly. I'd not been looking after myself and was floored by my first ever panic attack in a shopping center in Sheffield. It was horrendous as many on here know I'm sure.

From there it was a constant uphill battle. I was on venlafaxine for about 5 years and attended fortnightly/monthly CBT with psychiatric nurse. This helped. But it wasn't until I was shown conscious breathing that I felt like it been given a genuinely powerful tool for changing how I felt.

Skip forward another 15 years and by practicing the things I learned in CBT, mindfulness and conscious breathing I have just left a successful 11 year career in pastoral care in education to try something new. I went from Teacher to Year Head to Vice Principal, and at every stage I was championing mental health.

That brings us to today. I am now working full time on a new product I created that teaches and guides conscious breathing. It's called Luma¬≥ (lumacube) and it's launching soon for crowdfunding.

Luma¬≥ sits with you while you work and periodically illuminates to nudge you into breathing for 5 minutes. It then uses light and colour to guide you though the practice.

The big part of this though is the 10:1 Initiative. For every 10 sold one goes free to a school to support young people's mental health and wellbeing. We will send them a Luma¬≥ alongside a pack of resources on how to use it to support young people.

I'm very proud of how far I've come since that day in the Sheffield shopping center. I still have some very tough days from time to time but I know I can get though then because of the tools and strategies I've learned. Luma¬≥ and the 10:1 Initiative are my way of helping more people feel the same way.

Thanks for reading this. Take care and stay strong.

About two weeks ago I decided to get more serious about my skincare. I spend a lot of time outside and have a family history of skin cancer, so it seemed like a good idea. 

I bought some chemical sunscreen which I liked, but then I found out that it gets absorbed into the bloodstream and the FDA doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actually safe?

That gets me all worried, so I go out and buy mineral sunscreen. That makes me look like a ghost and dries out my skin, but no skin cancer is a plus. 

Then I see that mineral sunscreens are using nanoparticles and the FDA doesn‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôve been having stress headaches for two weeks because of stupid sunscreen. 

Realistically, both mineral and chemical sunscreen have been used for decades and never associated with major health issues, so either one is probably safe to use.

Honestly this post is more of a rant than anything else. I know alcohol is not great, it's a depressive. I know my anxiety has rocked me completely off my socks and that's why I'm on meds. 

I'm also receiving therapy, well just starting it. I'm making headway with most things and feeling more settled. I was so happy this week that I felt that it must be wrong and maybe it's a bit or mania.

Anxiety has literally ruled my life for the last 5 years so I'm hoping getting a handle on it will let me get some of my life back.

So anyway, I had half a bottle of wine, not a full bottle. Just bloody half and I drank extremely slowly throughout the day and diluted it with plenty of soda water. I ended up with chest pain and then panic attack with the usual craziness about thinking about heart issues. Sweating, tingles, numbness and all sorts. I breathed and calmed down eventually with my phone in my hand wanting to know I had the option to ring an ambulance.

So yeah I'm annoyed that I cannot even have a couple of alcoholic drinks and relax like ever.

Anyway, has anyone got any advice on coping mechanisms for panic attacks?"

 Last week, I had my first panic attack and it was so bad that my parents took me to the emergency center at our nearest hospital to make sure it wasn't something physical. I felt a tightness in my chest and left arm and we were worried it was issue with my heart. Ultimately, the doctors said I was healthy and that this was a panic attack. I started therapy and through talking to my therapist we seem to think this might be an anxiety disorder. She did refer me to a couple of psychiatrists to see if I need any medication and I will talk with one later this week. 

Through out this last week I have had periods were I felt calm and normal only to have feelings of worry or that something bad is going to happen to me. It hasn't been as bad as my initial attack and as the days have gone by I have started to feel better. The big issue right now is that my work seems to be a trigger. 

On my days off, I feel better and seem to have more control on how I'm feeling. But the the last time I was at work and currently, I seem to feel worse. Mainly, what I feel at work is a feeling that I'm not breathing right. It feels like my nose is clogged or that not enough air is getting through. Last time it got so bad that after work I went to nearby urgent care to get checked again and again I was told I was healthy. And right now I'm feeling like not enought air is getting through and wanting to go home. 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is one, if its anxiety that is causing me to feel like my nose is clogged or not getting enough air? And two, will I need to leave this job and find a new one if I keep feeling this way? I've talked to family members about what I'm experiencing and  they have all suggested finding a new job or getting a second job because they feel what is causing this is the fact the I have too much free time and i just need to be more busy and have more things to distract myself with. The thing is, I like my job. I work at a librabry and its not too stressful. My coworkers are great. I just dont understand why its a trigger.

I had all the tests done last year under the help of a Colorectal consultant, FC stool test, FIT test, CT of abdo/pelvis and a colonoscopy, all coming back clear.

I‚Äôve been having a very very bad period of anxiety recently, probably the worst I‚Äôve ever had in my life. It all started a couple months ago when I got a pretty bad UTI, I‚Äôm a young male (23 years old), healthy overall, and my doctor thought it was strange that I had a UTI, so he ran tests and found I had very high cholesterol. Being the hypochondriac that I am, I assume it‚Äôs the end of the world, and I was already very worried about the whole UTI situation and thought I had some bladder issues.

My UTI had also been giving me restless sleep because I constantly had to wake up to pee. This got me into a pattern of not being able to sleep well, even after the UTI was gone. So now I‚Äôm anxious about sleep, and went through a week of serious insomnia where I had a total of 6 hours of sleep for 5 days.
I started taking melatonin which has helped a bit, but my sleep still isn‚Äôt back to normal.

And I‚Äôm a senior in college, also working full time, and about to move out with my girlfriend. So I have a shit load of stuff on my mind, and the past 5 days I‚Äôve had terrible headaches. Borderline migraines. They‚Äôre just bad enough that they‚Äôre slightly affecting my ability to concentrate on school work and stuff. I think they have to be tension headaches because the day before they started I noticed my neck was sore.

When i did this, i stopped going on social media unless it was anonymous and not heavy on socializing. I stopped texting my online friends and in my online groups. I noticed i was getting too attached to people across the globe and getting jealous when it looked like they were flirting with other girls, and getting severe anxiety to the point of feeling i need to drink a lot more (i was close to alcoholism at that point due to the TEMPORARY anxiety easing effects of it. I say temporary in all caps because i found out from experience that my rebound anxiety the next day would be worse than usual and i would self medicate with even more alcohol. I didn't find out until i stopped drinking nearly as much. Oh hey, there's an extra tip! Break from drinking if you so dare! Please do if you know you have too much and you sense yourself going down a hole) due to the online drama i would get into. It didn't matter if it was in real life or online, i still cared too much what some random stranger with a joker profile picture thought of me and my opinions. I suspect I'm not alone in this!

I finally had enough at this point. I was tired of getting stressed out by online friends and strangers and drinking that i just decided i was done with socializing online for awhile and that i need to indulge in some much needed me time by reading and catching up on shows (without looking at my phone the whole time! I actually had to pay attention!) and i just decided to try it for a week. I told my friends what i was going through and that i needed a break. They were very supportive! Please don't be afraid of being honest with the people you trust with stuff like this, i think you're more likely to be pleasantly surprised by the support than disappointed!

So during my break, i dedicated my time to reading fanfiction, learning some Swedish, and watching Netflix and YouTube. I only texted my parents and anyone else i needed to. And oh my goodness, it felt like my soul was on vacation floating on a pool in a raft with a pina colada in hand! It made quite the difference! I grew emotionally distant from the online friends i was getting too attached to and i stopped feeling anxious of potential conflict because i had no conflict with anyone! No mean people online! Now it's been almost a year exactly and I'm still taking my break but I've returned to messaging my friends a tiny bit once in awhile just to keep up the friendships and make sure they're alright.

But I've never found more time to do more productive things than when i made myself leave my phone for longer than I'm used to. I feel like i don't care near as much what people think since my ears aren't being pumped full of judgments or anything that makes me jealous every day!

I apologize for the long post, but i just had to share my experience with this and hope this helps somebody else like me out there. Nobody deserves to feel scared just to exist and to fear any conversation that takes place from some rude stranger or some useless argument online."

562,CloudPast,Therapy,1,Anxiety,1619282983,"Not sure which type of therapy I should get Hello Reddit. I‚Äôm a young guy (20M) struggling with his mental health. I‚Äôm from the UK. 

It all started when I was bullied at the age of 15 by own best friend after we fell out. The bullying was severe and long lasting. He destroyed my confidence and made me insecure. I became generally very anxious after this experience, particularly, social anxiety. I also noticed I was much more critical and negative towards myself. 

Over the next 3 years of school things slowly got worse. I went to Uni at 18 and my anxiety got much worse. Now, on top of the other symptoms, I‚Äôm unable to sleep properly and I‚Äôm on edge every moment of the day. I also constantly question my abilities and think to myself that I‚Äôm not good enough. 

I‚Äôm clearly in need of therapy (will be going private), but I‚Äôm not sure which type of therapy to get, though I‚Äôve done some research. So I‚Äôll present my current thoughts to you. 

ACT and CBT are about thoughts/ behaviour in the present moment. ACT is about accepting what thoughts come your way and committing to proceeding in a way that reflects your values. CBT involves evaluating your thoughts and coming up with more rational/ balanced ones.
I have had some success with both - through a therapist (who I no longer see) and self-help - however I feel like they‚Äôre only a quick fix - they deal with automatic thoughts as they arise, but they don‚Äôt tackle underlying problem. So my anxious/ depressive thoughts inevitably come back to plague me. 

Psychoanalysis looks at past events in your life and how they link to present difficulties. However it‚Äôs very long (many years) and intensive (multiple times a week) which would be difficult for me. I‚Äôve also heard about psychodynamic, which is less intense and would seem more manageable, but I‚Äôm confused as to what the difference is.

Even though the bullying was the main event, I also generally didn‚Äôt have a good time in secondary school (high school). 

I feel like I haven‚Äôt processed and moved on from the bullying/ secondary school experience and I‚Äôm still ‚Äústuck‚Äù  in that moment, even though it was 5 years ago. I regularly get unpleasant memories from that time. I constantly think back to it. And I think the trauma from that experience is directly linked to the anxiety and depression I get today. It was the anchor point. So if I can recover from that experience, maybe my anxiety/ depression will go away. 

Hence, I thought maybe the PTSD treatment (EMDR) may help me get over this trauma.

To further complicate things, I may have Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome. Growing up, I was always described as ‚Äúlacking common sense‚Äù due to my inability to understand or judge certain situations. This got much worse at Uni, to the extent that at least 3 medical professionals have told me to get an Asperger‚Äôs screening. 

So Asperger‚Äôs is another factor to consider.

To summarise, my main problems are anxiety, depression, trauma and Asperger‚Äôs traits. 

However, less significant symptoms I suffer from are OCD (I get regular disturbing intrusive thoughts) and porn withdrawal (I stopped watching porn ages ago but get really intense cravings)

There are also therapies I haven‚Äôt even mentioned or know about, like Humanistic, Person-centred, DBT, etc. So I‚Äôm really quite clueless. 

So I really don‚Äôt know which kind of therapy to go for. It seems like it‚Äôll have to be a therapist who can do multiple kinds of therapy, but I want to make sure I go for the right ones. If you could recommend a type of therapy, or tell me which professional would be able to, that would be great. 

One key thing that‚Äôs more important than the others is to get past my trauma, which I believe is the underlying cause for all this.

TLDR; I have symptoms of anxiety, depression, trauma, Asperger‚Äôs traits and porn withdrawal. Don‚Äôt know which kind of therapy to get."

So the past few weeks it seems my anxiety has EVOLVED lol. Or rather it feels different from when I was a kid if that makes sense. Currently I am on 75mg of zoloft and was on buspar for 4 days but it made my anxiety way worse and sick. HOWEVER, currently I always am tired and drained and randomly my heart will start to speed up from 65-73 bmp‚Äôs to 85-100bpm and it‚Äôs a very uncomfortable feeling in the center of my chest or an unsettling feeling if that makes sense. I feel like my zoloft isn‚Äôt working anymore since this shit is happening and it‚Äôs so annoying. I go for walks everyday almost for 30-45 minutes to get exercise but this feeling in my chest is an awful like sick feeling? That‚Äôs the only word that fits is ‚Äúsick‚Äù. It‚Äôs such an awful feeling and then I hop onto dr google to try to figure out what‚Äôs going which is just a vicious cycle. Am I going crazy or is their light at the end of the tunnel? 

Also on a lighter note I have an appointment with a psychiatrist May 6th to assist but all my friends that have anxiety make it worse by saying to go to dr if my chest hurts..... like I have done EKG‚Äôs blood tests everything. And it‚Äôs all normal or I am ‚Äúa healthy young man‚Äù so I am just at my breaking point and feel like my life is being robbed from me :( 

Does anyone feel similar or do I really have a possible heart problem (I know I don‚Äôt I just have to say it to make myself feel better just in case)"

Since 2 months ago,i've started having prolonged continuing symptomes, physical, mental and way more, these symptoms are eating me from the inside and making me hopeless, making me think it's chronic and the only way stopping them are with medications, which is also my biggest fear right now, i'll be going to a therapist in the next week and I am concerned that the physical symptomes and mental symptoms won't disappear after some sessions, and then I will have to take medications, I resist in any kind or form to take any medications, it's way worse than the symptoms as I heard, and i've been taking ritalin for about 6 years and then stopped, I don't ever want to go back taking medications daily for 4 - 5 years.   
Has anyone here got their physical and mental symptoms ""cured"" or lowered with the anxiety disorder itself disappearing?   
here's some examples for the symptoms:   
\-----------------  
Muscle twitching (mostly in temporal areas and chest), chest tightness, chest heaviness, stabs in chest, tingling in chest, feeling of a bone in chest, alot of types of prresure in chest, fast heartbeat, feeling of something happening and I must wake up or something (kind of a shock), difficulity breathing, flowing in chest, tingling around body, stabs in alot of places in the body, itchiness in chest, headches, feeling of something being crushed in head, prresure in head, dizziness, flowing in head, feeling of a bone in head, tingling in head, stabs in head (especially in the  Os parietale), confusion, forgotness, feeling tired, quickly being exahusted after being active, difficulity constraining/focusing, always stressed, sometimes it gets worse then normal, always feeling sad, always bad thoughts, being scared too much of my surrounding, being scared of things going on in my body or my family's body (headches, red spots on body and more), always  Hypochonder about stuff and negative, seeing blurry, hard to see from far, having less fun doing things I love, seeing blurry looking at screens and etc.   
I really don't want to grow up living like this everyday or taking medications, i'm too young, I have a life infront of me, I don't want to make my family upset or stressed more, I want to live happily, i've always been like that, a coward who gets scared of everything, I am too soft, I am Hypochonder, i'm negative and I don't want to sound rude or anything, but whenever I think about something, the oppisite happens, if I think about the oppisite of the oppisite, then oppisite of it is happening, which just makes me more negative and less motivated,   
  I am a paranoid and the covid 19 outbreak made me even a bigger paranoid which triggerd the anxiety, I just don't want to grow up like this with this pain/ taking medications.   
For those who respond, I thank you so much."

I posted this past weekend because I went to the ER with what I thought was vaccine side effects a week after getting it. All my tests came back normal and they told me that it was maybe a panic attack. This past Wednesday I felt bad, made a doctor's appointment, and ended up on 10mg of Paxil for anxiety. I ran some errands yesterday and today (walking about 0.5 miles each way) and was panting and out of breath. My sister came to visit this morning because I've been feeling like hot garbage and told me to contact my doctor since that's not normal. This was after I got out of breath walking with her to get bagels.

I know my anxiety is shit because my dentist recommended yoga for my jaw pain. I know my long distance partner left on Tuesday and I was really sad. I know I didn't sleep well Tuesday night or the night I was in the ER. I'm supposed to do an intensive work program for a month in a little over a week and I'm worried about not feeling better by then. Between the neck pain, ibs, leg, foot, and hand pain, headaches, and now the panting, I'm wondering if it's not just anxiety. I've never dealt with anxiety before in this way, the fact it has physically manifested is driving me mad. I feel that every day I need a sick day, but I push through it. I hate that my body is failing me. I just want to feel normal.

tl;dr: I have been feeling sick for a week now and every doctor told me it's anxiety. Sure I have anxiety, but I think something else is really wrong with me."

I feel so anxious about this because my best friend and her husband just contracted covid after their first shot. I‚Äôve told him everyone needs to wear masks in our home. We get our second shots on April 29th.

I was free from it from September to December 2020 and then so far these past four months of 2021 I‚Äôve been struggling. I started getting palpitations in August 2019 because that‚Äôs when I hit rock bottom I struggled from August 2019 to March 2020 before I excepted it and got help. I went to the emergency room in August when I had palpitations I had only a few but I was very scared they hooked me up to a EKG for a little bit she said I had some benign PVCs but A normal heart rate I was just extremely anxious and they gave me a Xanax and I calm down and it went back to normal my heart rate but overall the palpitations were benign. I was still really struggling so in March 2020 I found a really great doctor I‚Äôm still seeing him and when I told him about my palpitations he was certain that they were anxiety related and somewhat maybe stomach related because he said you have more serotonin receptors in your stomach. I guess I‚Äôm sitting here today because I‚Äôve had for EKGs over the last year and a half and they‚Äôve all said that I have normal sinus rhythm and that I have a good heart I did have a Holter monitor test early September 2020 because I was having weird symptoms from being on a medication that I got off of and everything went back to normal. But I still was never diagnosed with anything heart related other than some palpitations being PVCS and PACS. my doctor tried to reassure me that they‚Äôre normal and a lot of people got them anyhow I do notice that whenever I have diarrhea which is often and it can be anxiety induced or just buy something I ate I do feel palpitations not many just a couple and I truly think that it‚Äôs related... when I see my doctor in a couple weeks I‚Äôm going to tell him that I do think it‚Äôs related with my digestive issues of course I‚Äôm not sure but I wonder if that really causes it because I get a lot of gas and then I have hot diarrhea sorry I don‚Äôt mean to sound gross but I honestly feel like this Hass to be linked somehow and maybe if we fixed my stomach the palpitations would ease? i don‚Äôt have them everyday, sometimes 5 times a day sometimes 1 time, sometimes 15 a day or none for a week.. then i sit here and wonder if i have POTS but then im told all the tests ive had would have picked it up. honestly i dont know what to do if i cant get this under control my anxiety.."

I know i can get through this since before the mandatory service i had my shit together but my coping mechanism has always been isolation and now its really hard to find some alone time.

Hey guys,

I‚Äôve booked an appointment with a psychologist next week but for the last 3-4 weeks give or take I‚Äôve developed some pretty intense obsessions in regards to my relationship. I‚Äôve seen my partner 4 times this week and yet every single day without fail I am crippled by the fear of them leaving, them abandoning me, them keeping me around until there is something better in a way that is detrimental to my ongoing life. I have no diagnosis or anything but I have an inkling it‚Äôs probably some sort of OCD since I‚Äôve shown traits in the past but nothing of the sort.

He is great and tries very hard to support me - he is very much an independent, busy person who is always doing something but when I need him he is always there to hear me out and when he‚Äôs with me he makes the effort to take care of me (ensure I‚Äôve eaten, feed me, comfort me, sit with me and show physical affection, always making sure to shift back to a topic if he didn‚Äôt address it fully so as not to worry me) so that I don‚Äôt feel this way but I cannot kick it and it is killing me. I could show up on his doorstop completely unannounced and he‚Äôd welcome me with open arms. I saw him yesterday after and this morning I woke up crying as though the great day we spent together didn‚Äôt happen at all. I want to be able to leave him alone and let him get the time that he needs to enjoy his life and be free but I am very scared that I‚Äôll end up sabotaging our relationship by becoming clingy and i have no idea where this came from because I used to see him once a week and be completely fine.

598,heartscythee,Work/School,2,Anxiety,1619263241,"Constant anxiety about intelligence? I have trauma from childhood, and adulthood relating to my perceived intelligence. I otherthink relatively simple tasks, like my morning routine, specifically how could I optimize the order in which I perform tasks and maneuvers in order to get ready the fastest way possible, if I make a miscalculation I call myself an idiot (But then remind myself these tasks mean virtually nothing about my intelligence). 

I have distant memories from childhood which snowballed my anxiety into what it is now. In middle school I was in a math class 1 grade higher than mine, and in 7th grade, I ended up failing out the class. It was really traumatic for me, my mom made me read emails about my failing grade from my teacher, I remember trying to catch up but it was ultimately too late for me to catch up again. I remember I failed because I was always daydreaming in class and drawing all over my notes when I needed to focus on math. I remember feeling shame because I got kicked out of the class a week before this other kid who failed the class for accidental placement was removed too. After that I got moved back to my grade level in math had to take a quiz the 2nd day in it, which I failed because I didn't remember the learning material. The teacher didn't let me make it up because it was stuff I ""should have already known"" even though I'm now 20, thinking back on it I feel like a failure and that intelligence is just an inherent genetic trait I was just not born with. 

In college I got extremely depressed and got put on academic probation for having a 1.7 gpa, but I am working on fixing it at community College, I also just earned my AA. I know I'm not ""stupid"" but i always feel like a chunk of my brain is missing, and I'm not as smart as everyone else. Maybe its my narcissist God complex issues talking, and making me feel bad for not knowing everything. 

People are so intelligent, they can engineer rockets, build ai computers, and do long division. 

I can't do any of those things, and I hate myself for trying, or even wanting to try, I just wish I could be smarter so that I'd be more useful for society. Its both weirdly specific and vague, but that's part of what fuels my anxiety. 

Technology has advanced so much in the short lifetime I've lived. I feel so distant from this future thats ever so present in my daily life. I don't know how my phone works, how it just magically has touchscreen capabilities, and can display images and videos with the click of a screen. I admire science so much it makes me wanna cry, but I'm so terrible at math it feels like it's impossible to even go for it. 

I failed precalculus in college, and retook it with a B-. I don't exactly find joy in make, it actually makes me sweat profusely, and gives me extreme anxiety depending on how much I dont understand the problem. Im so embarrassed. 

I've decided to become an art + history major, to teach English abroad. So there's no reason really to learn math or coding, but I understand how lucrative it is to the function of our society.. I feel so useless without it. 

I have a hard time processing information unless I'm really interested in it. If there's a certain topic I love (e.g. history) I could talk about it forever. 

I try researching neuroscience articles on how to increase neuroplasticity, I feel so empty. 
I feel like a dumbass for not knowing how political structures and events effect history. 

When I do try to teach myself these new things I forget them instantly. It feels like I'm missing a part of my brain. 

How do I help myself out of this situation and also become smarter in the process? 

Is intelligence even real anyways. Sigh. This is what I get for living in society"

For other reasons not related to anxiety, I've been suspecting that I may have autism. 

One of the symptoms that I think could be anxiety is avoidance.

 Whenever I'm watching a movie I tend to pause it and do something else when an action scene is on or some other really exciting scene. I also find it difficult to study as well due a **tight feeling in my chest**. I could be obsessed with a topic, but this still happens. 

I've had therapy for my anxiety due to other unrelated reasons. I mentioned this movie/studying with to my therapist and be seemed quite confused and advised me to just stick with it. That makes sense as therapy for anxiety basically involves sticking with something until the anxiety goes away, but it still doesn't seem to work or maybe I'm not trying hard enough. 

**Do you suspect that this avoidance behaviour is due to anxiety or could it be autism**?

608,AnAwakenedEarth,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1622450223,"About time &amp; giving you a reminder to rest / stop for a moment In this age of anxiety we people are raised in a way to think about time almost constantly. We think and talk about time so much that we even start to act like the future and past are something real. But there is no future and there is no past. And there will never be a future or past. The only moment there is, and ever will be, is the present moment. 

And yes it's possible to think about ¬¥the future¬¥ or about ¬¥the past¬¥. But even that thinking takes place in the present moment. And when the future comes, you are not living in the future. You are still in the present moment. Every moment of your life you are living in the present moment. The future and past are just human created illusions. 

And let's be very clear about it. With the present moment I do not mean today. I do not mean this hour. Or these minutes in which you are reading this. With the present moment I mean this moment. And the way to really experience this moment is to stop thinking. When you will take yourself back to the present moment, most of your problems will disappear. Because most of your worries will probably be about something that has happened in the past, or about something that will happen in the future. And when living in the present moment you will not worry about the past or future, because they do not exist. 

To be aware of the present moment we sometimes just need to rest / stop for a moment. So in [this telegram channel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paGVgaFS786LoRGRxr8POZn5demgHZs0/view?usp=sharing) you will get a daily reminder to rest for a moment. Feel free to join :)"

A couple of days ago he told me that he wanted to stop doing that. He keep the same password but now he doesn't give me his phone or iPad if i need them. I know that he wants to have more privacy because we are together 24/7 because of covid, but i can't help to feel anxious.

At the same time he closed his instagram and started using his secondary account which is private and i don't follow because i can tell that he doesn't want me to do so. This doesn't help either.

I don't want to snoop really, that's not what i want; i want him to know that he can give me his phone when i need it for something in particular and that i'm not going to go through his stuff. I already told him that but he's keeping his position. 

For more context, in the past he told me that he had albums of girls (celebrities) and i told him that i wasn't confortable with that. He errased them a long time ago but i guess that can be one of the reasons he doesn't want to share his phone anymore.

Although since middle school, i get this anxious feeling in my chest hitting me out of nowhere. Sometimes it lasts for minutes, hours, days. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt happen for months or even one or two years. I always tried to understand where it comes from but truly sometimes i cannot find any reason at all. 

It makes my heart beat fast, my chest is bursting with this awful feeling, almost as if i‚Äôm expecting something bad to happen. I used to question if it was my sixth sense telling me something bad will happen. I don‚Äôt think that anymore. I try to let it go, focus on other things, taking deep breaths. It does help and sometimes it goes away. These days it always come back though. I feel it getting worse.

613,Anxiousdudeatnight,DAE Questions,1,Anxiety,1622446185,"I‚Äôve never had anxiety until now, and I want to know if my experiences are from anxiety or a more serious medical problem Hey everyone,

To preface, I have diagnosed depression, however it was never extreme and I was able to manage it through self growth and therapy. I attempted meds but I never found one that worked, however I got by without it. During 2019-2020, I was doing extremely well and then when COVID hit I began to personally fall back into a groove of being lazy, unproductive, and quite frankly unhealthy. As time went on, I believe I developed anxiety. I haven‚Äôt spoken to a medical professional about this, however I do plan on scheduling an appointment soon. 

My biggest issue is I realized lately I‚Äôm hyper fixated on every feeling/weird sensation in my body and it causes me to panic thinking I have some terminal illness. 

Some symptoms include heart murmurs, disassociation, and trouble swallowing. Last night I believe I had my first ever panic attack. I was having an already pretty anxious night, but at one point when I was laying in bed I attempted to swallow and my throat would not move whatsoever. This lasted about 2-3 seconds before I could swallow again. This began difficulty for me to swallow when I focused on swallowing itself. Is this normal? The same thing happened tonight. I have no problems eating food, drinking water, anything during the day. But once I start feeling anxious at night that‚Äôs when it starts.

I also tend to feel disassociated a lot and I almost feel like I lose control of my body and I‚Äôm either watching myself or I completely drift away and I need to jerk myself to regain composure. This scares my the most as I hate the feeling of not being in control of my own self. 

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to respond and help me ease my mind, I‚Äôve had a rough few nights and would like to know if these are common with anxiety or a more serious issue.

FYI - I haven‚Äôt been getting much sleep lately and I‚Äôve read that really affects anxiety, I wonder if this plays a part in all of this."

Another factor is covid and isolation. The lockdown undoubtedly had an effect on me, and being stuck inside all day my adhd mind was suffering a little bit. My brain was yearning to lose a little control for just once. I took a hit from the bong, clearing it, though there wasn‚Äôt much left. I inhaled a little more than I usually do. Almost immediately I felt the now finalist symptoms of a bad high riddled with my anxious tendencies. Usually I can distract myself and wait it out after an hour or so. But this time was different. 

Long story short, I ended up in an almost catatonic state, my fave completely flush and discolored, along with my eyes. I ended up in the staircase throwing up five times, nothing but water, only worsening the symptoms of dehydration. This was an experience different than any other I had in the past. There were moments where I was so convinced I had let my mind go too far and there was no recovering and that I was going to die, and my brain would rot in a spiral of insanity. I thought I had lost my mind. There are really no words to describe what I was feeling, and I know how corny this might sound, especially those of you who have experience with psychedelics, but I think I may have experienced ego death, and possibly even psychotic symptoms. 

The weirdest part was the following few days, the whole thing felt like a bad dream, and my brain was convinced it genuinely never happened. It surprisingly didn‚Äôt effect me at all for a few months, but I‚Äôve slowly realized recently that I may have trauma tied to it. 

I know this may sound like a weed story, but I am almost positive that if I didn‚Äôt have my anxiety disorder and adhd as well, I would not have had the same experience. I guess I just wanted to share and maybe hear from anyone else who has experienced something similar, whether it be weed, other drugs, or completely sober. Thanks for reading if you did."

634,kawaiikidney,Sleep,1,Anxiety,1622436423,"I've gad nighttime anxiery my whole life. Growing up until late high school it was a sheer terror of the dark. Recently it's just fear of sleep itself. Just woke up, for no reason, after 30 mins of sleep. Am riddled with anxiety and heart thudding. I feel like I'm dying. As a child, I would cry myself to sleep when I was in darkness. The feeling of terror sometimes still overwhelms me. I have very strong irrational fears that I am struggling to get through and the night/sleep is still such a big one. 

My only remedy is the phone. There was a period in my life where only youtube helped because i'd hear people talk on there and I didn't feel alone. I'd wake up at 2 or 3 am every single night and have to stay awak until 4 or 5 because of my anxiety, wherein I feel like I'm dying/being watched. Every single goddamn time even now I'm so tired. Normal sleep is rare. 

I am so tired and I feel like I'll never have normal sleep. Sometimes I get terrified to sleep, like there are nights where I'm so anxious or have woken up just because, and when I try to go back to sleep I jump awake because the process is scary. 

I sleep with my full body under the blankets and covering my ears AT ALL TIMES no matter HOW HOT it gets and if I can get an eye mask oh man, my sleep is good because I'm not scared of seeing things at night. I am so scared of seeing things so irrationally because I have not seen anything. But my sleep has been so royally fucked my entire life because of this crippling fear. 

This reality feels normal. I have never felt safe. Safety is slim to none for me. 

My anxiety (or paranoia??) Has plauged me for so long... I'm so tired, why does this happen? Can anyone explain or even relate? So many other things that happen but this is just so grating, constant, every day... I hate how crippling my anxiety is :("

655,AuthenticGlitch,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1622428333,"Anxiety, Panic attack? So this is like the 2nd time this has happened to me, I wake up because of a full bladder or cats are having one of their late night parties and I decide to go empty my bladder. After I'm done I go and lay back down and bam I start getting clammy and hot, heart starts to race because I can feel my heartbeat all over my body, then the thoughts of impending doom begin. Now as someone who has strong will power and meditated off and on since I was 17(now 30), these thoughts are scary in themselves because I can usually focus without issues. 
Now I don't get chest pain so that helps me think I'm not having a heart attack even though my mind constantly goes to heart attack due to the other symptoms like feeling hot, claminess, and impending doom thoughts.
 The first time this happened I got up from laying down and it felt like I was fainting so I sat down quick and focused on my breathing and after like 15 minutes I started to come out of it. Now this time around I stayed laying down and focused on my breathing, and after about 5 minutes I started to get chills and slightly shaky and then finally after another 10 minutes fell asleep. But the following day I had this worry of it happening again which caused general anxiety but manageable nonetheless. 

Is this anxiety or a minor panic attack? Its rather new to me at this intensity.  I've also noticed throughout the last week I feel like I can't get a full satisfying breathe sometimes, but it's not real shortness of breath because I used to have asthma and know what that feels like, this is just a ""feeling"" of not getting enough even though I clearly am because I can workout fine. Sorry if this seems scattered I'm just slightly worried and wondering what other people's thoughts are on this and anxiety in general is rather new to me, I also hate going to see doctor's or the ER and would rather avoid it, even though I may go at some point just in case."

658,cloalabear,Recovery Story,3,Anxiety,1622427709,"Overcoming anxiety isn't easy but the process is simpler than you think I want to start off by saying I'm not downplaying the severity of anxiety and all the symptoms that comes along with it. The past 6 months of my life has been the worst- frequent panic attacks, not being able to eat, sleeping too much, crying every single day. You name it- I've probably felt it before. My emotions were all over the place and it felt like I couldn't control my emotions and feelings. I hated it. I hated not being in control, I hated my anxiety and I hated why I felt the way that I did. I went for psychiatrist appointments, therapy and tried out new hobbies to make myself feel better. But it was so hard, some days were worse than others and i thought I wasn't making progress. Often times I would feel like I would never get better.

I started to get better when I put less focus all the problems I were facing. I noticed that if I stopped putting so much stress on what I can do right, but instead being thankful for what I already have, I felt more safe and secure in my surroundings. I used to wake up and list every single thing that has went wrong or could go wrong in my life, and the negative thinking severely affected my mindset. I knew that every night I would stay up worrying about every single detail of my life, so I started to do other things, like crocheting, knitting, reading the bible. Instead of avoiding my anxiety, being angry at myself, I had alot of time to face it, think about it and think of ways to improve. For me knitting was one of the most therapeutic things I could do, knitting being a repeated process, kind of putting my brain on autopilot. I was able to be calm and think calmly. So instead of lying around, sleeping or watching TV to avoid the root problem, I decided to face it head on to truly understand myself.

 I also realised that putting less focus on myself as a person really helped. Yes, understanding yourself is important but thinking about other people helps you to realise how lucky you are for having loved ones around you. I started thinking more about other people, my friends, family and what I could do to show them how much I appreciate them for sticking by me. Doing things like writing letters, making dinner for them, or giving gifts (any way you show love really) helped me a bunch to appreciate what they've done for me.

 I kept comparing myself to everyone around me, how I wasn't smart enough, or good enough, or worthy enough. And honestly it's something that I still struggle with. Over the months I've come to a conclusion that I'll never be the best and I should stop trying so hard to expect so much of myself. People told me to lower my expectations of myself but I found that instead of telling yourself that, tell yourself to be humble, to stop wanting to be great, to want power over things. And stop wanting to be in control of everything. Anxiety stems from not being able to be in control. Letting go is hard, and I remember asking myself ""Everyone is telling me to just 'let go' but what does that even mean??? HOW??"". Everyone's path is different, but for me is was being content and accepting yourself for who you are is good enough. Our wants are endless.

I hope this helps someone or inspires someone today. You really are stronger than you think. Sometimes all it takes is some time and patience. I would have never thought I'd be where I am today; and I'm thankful that I've went through all the pain and hardships. You can do it too. I promise everything will be OK in the end."

I really do like who I am and I‚Äôm very excited for where my life/career is headed, but I‚Äôm constantly shrouded by this extreme anxiety that I just can‚Äôt shake off. I‚Äôm pretty sure all this was kickstarted by a bad trip on LSD about 11 months ago, and I‚Äôm so scared that I‚Äôve fried my brain for life.

I know brain zaps are a symptom of anxiety as well as withdrawal from ssri‚Äôs.

The lights in my room have been acting up only in the early hours and randomly go mental as well, and footsteps can be heard from the attic sometimes as my bro has also told me.

AITA for telling someone I didn‚Äôt see anything after his bike got stolen?

Admittedly the title sounds bad, this happened earlier today and it‚Äôs bothering me so I thought I‚Äôd get a fresh perspective. I was stood outside the food shop whilst my girlfriend was inside getting a few bits and pieces when I saw someone come out of the shop and get on a bike. I looked up from my phone for maybe a second and then looked back because nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

About 5 minutes later a man comes up to me and tells me his bike has been stolen and asked if I‚Äôd seen anything. I live quite close to the shop and I know that it has a fair few security cameras pointed where the bike was and there was absolutely nothing I could tell him about the man that got on his bike short of the fact that he was holding sunglasses. I couldn‚Äôt even tell him the direction because the shop is on a corner and I looked away before he started pedalling, so in the moment I decided to tell him that I didn‚Äôt see anything and he went inside to ask the shop to see the cameras. 

I thought it was better to do that rather than waste his time with details that wouldn‚Äôt help him and that he could get from the security camera (including the mans face, clothes and the direction he went, which I couldn‚Äôt give him) but now I think I should have told him what I knew.

I've had anxiety since I was a toddler, so there hasn't been a ""reason"" for it most of the time but of course life contributes to anxiety. I feel like a piece of my anxiety melted off today when I had a realization. 


I just set up my patio and sat outside next to huge flowering bushes, reading a novel, and my husband came out and handed me an apricot, smiled and sat down. Birds were chirping. My life is stunning! Alhamdulillah/praise God. My life was horrific for many years and the past few years have just gotten better and better. Sometimes I am jolted with how beautiful my life is. Big picture and little moments... 
But something has been nagging me, not just my usual anxiety but some deeper intense anxiety just nagging at me &amp; sometimes souring the intense gratitude I feel in those beautiful moments. 


I finally realized what it was! For some reason, I felt like since no one else appreciates my life, there is something wrong with me/my life. I'll try to explain.


My circle is extremely small. I have 11 contacts in my cell, 16 friends on Facebook, and no other social media. I don't have any friends at all and sparse family connections. A few strong bonds, but mostly I don't talk to anyone. My parents were abusive and I went into foster care, then became Muslim and most of my decent family rejected me. I only talk to my husband and my sister daily, my other sisters and sister in law weekly, and everyone else monthly or less or never. 
I don't have an online following.
I barely take photos. 
My beautiful, peaceful, happy life is really just in the moment with my husband. I love it, I feel safe, and I have no desire to post all about it online or reconnect with people, but I guess subconsciously it was causing anxiety that I don't have any confirmation that my life is good. 
When I came inside from the patio I just realized this and instantly felt relief!
Also, even as someone who doesn't use social media, I would find myself wondering what others would think while choosing clothing or furniture. It's so bizarre but even before social media, people did things based on what others think. 
I am so deeply grateful for my life and how much it has transformed a lovely dream from literally a nightmare. I truly don't care what people thing because I know that I'm happy and blessed. Idk why I had that anxiety but I did.

Now that I've consciously believed no one else needs to see or approve of my life, I believe it will sink into my subconscious and relieve a lot of anxiety!

721,Human-XII,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1625603653,"Having ""sweat attacks"" in socially uncomfortable situations, need advice on how to deal with them Hi !

I've had severe social anxiety since I was 10 years old, with the worst time being middle school. I'm now 23 years old and have been doing considerably better, I have friends, I've had relationships and I look mostly normal if not a little bit shy. So things aren't that bad, even though I still struggle a lot with very low self esteem, it's now less obvious and I can handle social situations normally.

The thing is when I'm in a socially uncomfortable position I sometimes have some sort of sweat attacks. My body temperature goes up considerably because of stress, which makes me visibly sweat, I notice it and stress even more which makes everything worse. It's a vicious circle that takes several minutes to break, sometimes even 10 minutes. Getting out of this situation and getting some fresh air  helps a lot.

It doesn't always happen, just sometimes. These situations can range from speaking in public (whether it's making a public presentation or just speaking at a party when everyone looks at me), or being uncomfortable about a specific topic, or even in a professional context if I'm uncomfortable with my hierarchy. It also happens when I walk somewhere and suddenly arrive in a social situation, for example walking to a party : I'll be fine on the way but when I get there the combination of the effort being stopped and a socially complex situation makes me sweat like crazy for a few minutes.

Summer with its hot temperatures makes it happen even more often (maybe once or twice a week) and people notice it when it happens. This can be really complicated in some situations..

Do you have any tips on how to deal with this ?

Thanks for reading !"
722,ruuune,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1625603260,"job offer causing crippling anxiety, any advice? Hi /r/Anxiety, 

I recently quit a very toxic job of 5 years after a nervous breakdown that meant I was signed off work for my notice period. (I'm under 30) Just before the breakdown, I applied for another job doing something pretty different (it's working under the local council but still with the public). I didn't get it, but they've since reached out with another offer to work there (with better hours) and I have been battling panic attacks since hearing from them. 

I think my fear comes from imposter syndrome. I feel like I've somehow tricked them into thinking I'm able to do the job when I won't be able to do any of it, or that they'll ask me to do things I have NO idea how to do. I worry that I'll end up constantly going to my supervisor there ""what needs doing now"" and they'll realise how incapable I am.

It's killing me because I know I'd be stupid not to take it and have to go back to job hunting, but the anxiety is eating me alive and I just want to run away and turn them down. I've just started a new antidepressant after coming off my old ones but it's not kicked in yet so the panic is...... crippling. I just keep crying.

730,XrossJay,Venting,4,Anxiety,1625601986,"My Story I'm a 20 year old English man that has lived in Portugal since I was 4.

I've suffered from anxiety for about 5 years.

It all started when I fainted in class (I was 14, in the[ Year 8 of the 3rd cycle of Basic Education)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Portugal#2%C2%BA_Ciclo_-_2nd_Cycle) whilst watching a documentary. I had never fainted before so it was obviously a little scary. The teacher called for an ambulance as everyone left the class, thanking me for getting them out of the lesson earlier. I was rushed to hospital and my mum met me there. The doctors ran some tests and everything was fine.

The next day I went back to school, somewhat frightened of what people would be saying about me. Once I got there, my ""friends'' rushed up to me and asked whether I was okay and showed genuine concern for my health (which I appreciated). Later however, the whole thing turned into a joke. In almost every lesson where I decided to lay my head down (due to boredom) they made fun of me. Sayings things like ""Here he goes again!"" and ""He's going to faint!"". They would also start pretending to be having a fit (shaking and twitching) to mock me. I know that this is common for 14 year olds to do but it hurt me nevertheless.

Even with all this going on I still went to school every day and had fun (at least as much fun as you can have going to school).

A few months later my time at that school came to a close and it was time to go to a new one **(Year 9 of the 3rd cycle of Basic Education).**

On my orientation day I walked nervously to the new school with one of my friends. Once we arrived my nerves hadn't subsided, which was unusual for me at the time. Sure, I expected to be nervous before my first day at a new school but I expected them to completely disappear once I got there. That's the day my anxiety started.

Every day I would fear going to school. I hated it.

All of a sudden my mind would start playing tricks on me. I had to leave the class whenever a teacher played a video because I started to panic. Certain words like ""fainting"", ""drugs"", ""needles"" or anything remotely squeamish became taboo (I couldn't hear or say them without having an anxiety attack).

Days, weeks and months went by as I tried to figure out what my problem was. I went to the counselor at the school, who just made me fill out paperwork and didn't help at all. I told my mum about what was happening but she thought it was just nerves. Nothing was right in my life anymore. My innocent days of going to school, having a boring but normal day, getting home, relaxing and going to sleep were over. Now my days were spent wondering why my body was acting this way.

Every day I would ask god to get me out of school (even though I'm not religious) to get me out of school. I was exhausted. Other than my online friends no one was there for me.

One day, I fell sick. I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

Finally, somewhat of a break.

Suddenly, I didn't have to go to school anymore. I was relieved.

After 6 months of blood tests and doctor's appointments I was walking by myself again and everything was fine. The school year was over and all I had to do was go back for my exams.

*EXTRA INFO: The night before my exams I was extremely nervous and told my girlfriend at the time. She shouted at me (""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU NERVOUS FOR!"") aggressively and wasn't supportive in the slightest. She even broke up with me for a week when I was sick (with the aforementioned Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and broke my heart. She was a downright mentally abusive girlfriend. I hate to say it but I began to mimic her ways of treating me as I was young and didn't know better.*

I did both my exams and finished school. I felt anxious during them but nothing bad happened (as is the usual with anxiety).

After the year ended I decided that I wanted to go somewhere else, so my mum helped me choose a new school. A picked an English school (all my previous ones were Portuguese) and chose to do A-Levels.

By this point I had discovered (through one of my many counselors and therapists) that I had anxiety. Before then ""nerves"" was the word I would use to describe it.

I enjoyed my time at my new school. I still had anxiety but it seemed to be somewhat less - probably because this humble establishment only held 200 students in total, as opposed to the approximately 2000 students at my previous school.

*EXTRA INFO: I enjoyed my classes and vibed well with the teachers!*

All was going well, until something happened which would change my life forever.

Two days before one of my exams, my best friend passed away. I remember the day like it was yesterday.

I had come home and decided to sit on the couch and start getting into TV Shows. I was more into anime at the time so I didn't understand any pop culture references unless they were related to Darth Vader being Luke's father. I decided that I would get into Star Trek. I watched one episode of The Original Series and was blown away by this new experience. I was gripped by this campy 60s show and couldn't wait to watch more. I went upstairs to play some video games and that's when I received a message from an old friend telling me what had happened. I was shocked and upset. I couldn't stop crying.

I remember hearing a few ambulances pass by my home the night before. Little did I know that they were for him (he died close to my home).

After this I shut down. I performed terribly at the exam and shut everyone out of my life.

The second year of A-Levels started 4 months later and I had come to terms with what had happened. However, this year I didn't talk to anyone in my class. I didn't want any friends. I only ever opened my mouth when in a lesson. Apart from that I would stick my earphones in (usually with no music even playing) and keep to myself. I could hear my classmates talking about me behind my back (it's funny how people think you can't hear anything when you have earphones in) which made me want to avoid them more (I hated high school drama).

Anyway, my second year of A-Levels finished in 2019 and I had no idea what to do next.

I had decided at some point that I didn't want to go to university and that I would rather get a job right after finishing my education. This proved to be difficult though, because for one, I don't like Portugal, and I was too anxious to apply for any.

A few months later me and my mum decided that I needed therapy but the kind I needed can't be provided in Portugal so I would have to move to England. I was happy about this decision.

In September of 2019 I moved to England. At first things were the same (if not worse). I wouldn‚Äôt leave the house unless it was for therapy (which I didn‚Äôt like), I‚Äôd just sit in my room with the curtains closed watching stuff on YouTube. Things changed though, in October, when I moved from the place I was staying (my great aunt's house) to my aunt‚Äôs house. I much preferred the environment there. My aunt and uncle were lovely to me and I had a feeling that they were always there for me. I gave up therapy and things sort of halted for a while. My anxiety was still quite high but I was actually going out, which was a big change.

Things stayed like this until May of 2020. 

I decided that I needed to tame my anxiety once and for all, so I started doing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

To this day, that is definitely the best choice I have ever made in my life. As soon as I started things began to change. I was going out to all sorts of places, testing out the boundaries of my anxiety, and I even got a job cleaning a bar! My therapy lasted until August 2020.

At that point I decided that I wanted to come back to Portugal, get an apartment of my own and find a job. So I did.

In September (2020) I was back in Portugal and had found an apartment. Things seemed different though. Suddenly, I didn‚Äôt want to go out anymore. I didn‚Äôt have that same drive that I had before. I was looking for jobs but hoping I wouldn‚Äôt get any offers, I would play podcasts all day because I couldn‚Äôt bear the silence, I would sit at home each night planning to run away and not tell anyone about it.

One night, I began having dark thoughts, so I called my mum and immediately broke down. She told me to come back home and that we would stop renting the apartment. So that‚Äôs what I did.

From October to December (2020) I didn‚Äôt do anything. I felt like I needed a break, so I took one. I‚Äôd help my mum around the house and do the shopping with her. I was content but knew that I had to move on soon.

It‚Äôs January 2021, and I discovered what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I started to teach myself web development. I can‚Äôt remember exactly how I began coding, but all I know is that as soon as I started doing it I felt happy. I taught myself HTML and CSS, I looked for and found a college that runs a two year Web Development course and signed up. 

In May (2021) I visited the college and I LOVED IT. I could imagine myself studying, living and making friends there. The one downside is that the course needs a minimum of 8 people to start - the course didn‚Äôt open the year before due to this issue. This didn‚Äôt put me off though, as I knew that this was DEFINITELY going to happen.

My anxiety remained at an all time low (barely even noticeable) and I was on top of the world.

This brings us - finally - all the way up to a week ago.

On the 1st of July (2021), I took it upon myself to email the college to find out how many students had signed up for the course. The answer was ‚Äú4‚Äù, but they had a few more interviews booked in.

This news made me slightly upset. I was now facing the harsh reality that this course may not go ahead and that I will be lost once again.

I looked at other colleges but none of them got my attention. 

*EXTRA INFO: I‚Äôm still keeping my hopes up!* 

The next day, I had an appointment booked at the opticians. It was a contact lens fitting. I really wanted contacts so I decided to just give them a go.

Everything started okay, he put the contact lenses in and explained to me how to take them out. I stood in front of the mirror, poking at my eyes, trying to remove the lenses, when all of a sudden I started getting agitated. I asked to sit down but quickly realised something bad was happening. I asked to go to the bathroom and walked there as fast as I could. My vision was going blurry and suddenly, I fainted. 

I was awoken by the receptionist and the doctor. They told me what had happened and helped me back into the into the ‚Äútest room‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called) where I then laid down on the concrete floor, sucking on a lollipop for a good 15 minutes before working my way up to sitting down on the chair and then moving out of the room onto the sofa in the waiting area. After about an hour I headed back home, already dreading that my anxiety had come back.

I spent the rest of the day at home watching Pok√©mon and relaxing as I felt exhausted after what had happened. 

The next day, I knew that I needed to go out. I had to see whether my anxiety had returned. I went to two stores. In the first, I felt some of the symptoms stronger than before, at the second store, I felt a bit better.

Since then, though, I still don‚Äôt feel right. Whenever I have to go to the store my anxious mind takes over again and it‚Äôs eating me up inside.

Something I thought that I had beaten had come back.

I didn‚Äôt want to allow things to go back to how they were, so I got my notes and sheets of exercises that I had learned in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and pinned them up on my wall. I even wrote ‚ÄúAnxiety symptoms are: harmless and temporary‚Äù on a piece of paper and stuck that up there too. Since then I‚Äôve been studying my notes and trying to put them into practice once more.

It‚Äôs currently the 6th of July and I still haven‚Äôt gotten back to normal.

I must say though, I feel so much better for getting this all out there."

In March, blood pressure was 126/63 but it has spiked up all of a sudden to 137/73 and 137/71 (May 2021). I emailed my doctor and asked if this was high and should I be worried. She said my blood sugar/cholesterol levels were fine (blood test was in march) and that it‚Äôs probably from anxiety and stress so i shouldn‚Äôt worry for now. I do have health anxiety but prior to May, I didn‚Äôt feel any big anxiety attacks so I didn‚Äôt know it could significantly impact my bp like that. However  I do get VERY anxious when they put that patch on, its very tight and the feeling of it letting go feels very uncomfortable. Does that affect my reading? I went to get another bp test last week and I was already completely nervous, my heart starting racing and once again, the patch makes me very anxious. My first reading was 153/83, the doctor let me sit down for 5 minutes so I can calm down. BUT, I was even more nervous because I was thinking about the first reading. In fact my heart started pounding faster. Still my blood pressure went down to 141/72. I thought she was going to give me a third test since it was going down but she told me I can come back in 2 weeks. So basically she left me thinking my blood pressure officially was 141/72.

When anxiety starts increasing physically even when my thoughts are calm, I start being too sensitive of my heartbeat and breathing, actually of all body functions which are usually normal. When I start feeling them I can't stop thinking about them. I try to distract, video games/videos/music/talking to others but then I just worry something might be wrong with me and all this usually leads to palpitations and difficulties breathing and increased anxiety. Please, I ask for advice and tips on how to deal with this. I can now control it/distract myself enough as it doesn't get to a full-blown panic attack, but it does affect my nervous stomach and is just an annoyance. Tips? Has it happened to you?

This is really freaking me out as I'm without my parents for the first time, and my anxiety is even worse now. I have crippling panic attacks almost daily.

I'm a 19f and I've been depressed and anxious since I was around 13. I also have OCD and ADHD. My life has been pretty fucking shit the last year and half or so like everyone else, but the last month in particular has just been throwing one punch after another at me. I've been suicidal in the past, but nothing like this. Despite being in therapy and finally deciding to try meds again (tried 3 different ones at 15 and all made me worse but I'm trying another out of desperation), I've never been this close to actually attempting to harm myself. 

Point is, I know I need help. Badly. What I'm doing now isn't enough. So naturally I thought I might benefit from staying in a mental hospital. But I've heard and read such incredibly mixed reviews on whether it's actually harmful or helpful. I'm in Massachusetts if that helps anyone have an idea of the type of care around me. But I'm worried about being disconnected from the world for an unknown amount of time especially while I'm trying to get a job. I'm also gluten free for health reasons (but not allergic) and have a lot of stomach issues (I'm low fodmap and acid too) and I'm worried about being able to have half decent food that works with my restrictions. I don't know what they would confiscate from me there so that I can know what to leave at home. I also don't know what I can bring for comfort like my own pillow and blankets? I don't know how much privacy I'll get. Things like that. I've done some research, but can't find much in depth.

If anyone could share their experiences especially if they went to one in MA I'd be incredibly grateful. Because having to make this decision with very little idea of how it would actually pan out is just bringing up more anxiety for me which I really don't need."

So, my case of anxiety is not as bad as some others that I've seen. In terms of getting a job, I know that a lot of us are lucky to have one. It's a luxury it seems and it's the new promotion. I see a lot of people who are struggling with social anxiety and desperately want a job but end up fighting themselves on asking for an app or keeping the job. I'm in the latter of these groups. I want a job so badly. I see everyone around me having a job, moving up the ladder. Leaving me behind. So I get a job. I feel good looking for the job because I feel like I'm doing something.

But then I get the job. And it's like all hell breaks loose within my mind. I've been employed at a retail store since Oct 2019. It's the longest I've ever been employed somewhere and I'm actually somewhat good at what I do. But I know I can't do it forever because the only time I'll get a ""raise"" is when the minimum wage gets bumped up. Not to mention, it's too comfy there. I feel I can only grow if I get out of my comfort zone. So I look for new jobs. Got a new one earlier this year but turned out to be a complete train wreck. Thankfully my old job let me back. Just started a new one again today and well the anxiety is all back again. I like that I'm out of my comfort zone but well that's anxiety for you. Even if you believe something is good (hence the decision you made) your anxiety will creep up on you. So now I'm sitting here stressing about if I'll be able to do my job.

I just don't know how to move past this. I'm just like, in this prison. My job is comfy yet boring, and doesn't pay well. And never will pay well. But I'm so gravitated to sticking with it simply because it's comfy. I just want to know that it'll be okay at my job. That I can go in, do my job right and go home. That's literally it. But my performance anxiety always just beats the shit outta me and I end up leaving every other job in less than 6 months.

First of all, I may not be diagnosed with anxiety but I think I do face a lot of anxiety, especially ever since I was taking the IB program. At that time, I was breaking down everyday after failing one of my practice papers and nothing could really calm me down. However, my anxiety drove me to work hard and eventually it paid off.

But regardless of that, for the entirety of my life, I never felt like I fit in anywhere properly. Sure I had some good friends and family members but I often doubted whether they truly love me for me and whether they only like me because of how much I care for them. Sometimes I just feel like my relationships aren‚Äôt balanced and sometimes I‚Äôm so tired of it. So this forms one portion of my anxiety, that I don‚Äôt have good friends or maybe that I‚Äôm not worthy or even that I‚Äôm not a good friend.

The next part of my anxiety is that now that I am in university and everyone around me is getting some type of internship or career opportunity that I am not. I always felt that I fell short of my goals my whole life, perhaps because the fear to achieve those goals weigh heavier on me than my drive, and yet, I still work very hard at the very last moment and do decently despite not really ever fulfilling my goals. But previously, those goals were for schools and the universities I wanted to enter. Now, my anxiety is about something far more crucial to my wellbeing ‚Äî my career prospects. Tbh, I probably am not as screwed as I think but I aspire to break into a competitive field in the corporate world and I just feel that I am not going to make it. I‚Äôm at such a loss, to a point whereby I doubt whether I am even capable of being hired as a normal cashier staff working at your local store / being a waiter etc because maybe I won‚Äôt be good enough, quick enough, strong enough. 

I dont know how but I have hit a point whereby a small mistake that I‚Äôve made really just makes me feel really horrible about myself, causing me to shut down and waste more time yet again instead of trudging on to pursue my goals. 

Has anyone ever felt any of these above-mentioned feelings? I just hope there‚Äôs a future for me, and of course i have to work for it but i just hope that one day, I can find the hope, trust and love I crave within myself.

I started this internship about 6 months ago. It's government-run, and I partake in the upgrade of a software architecture that they use. I love doing this work, it means a lot to both me and to the Laboratory I'm doing it for. What I hate, however, are presentations. For some reason, I could be so confident in my work but as soon as I begin speaking to a group of people, my lungs stop working. I mean, literally. I could seriously pass out within the first 3 seconds of a presentation. I completed the first term of the internship essentially on one leg. I had anxiety and panic attacks constantly, and over time my overall motivation decreased. Well, I went ahead and applied for a second term in the internship, and I totally wish I didn't. I've already cried for days over the practice presentation that I created. Today I was supposed to present it, and as soon as it was my turn I unplugged my internet and told the host that sharing screens caused my bandwidth to shoot through the roof. What a fucking joke. I'm extremely disappointed in myself. I don't know whether or not its the fact that these people are so ""important"" in my head, or that it's a ""government"" run *thing*, or if it's because of my recent breakup with my ex who basically held my hand through any and everything. Or maybe it's because my entire family is falling apart, my sister (20 y.o.) who I'm trying to keep safe from being an idiot is out getting in trouble, and I have no money to pay for my next college semester. Maybe it's because I'm the youngest person in the internship, surrounded by people who are studying things from quantum computing to particle physics. Maybe it's the trauma that I realized I had these past couple of years, that I still haven't had the time or avenues to address. Well, I have a makeup for the practice presentation tomorrow, and I guarantee I'm going to freak out the same exact way, I'm going to stop knowing how to breathe, my voice will get shaky until eventually the shakes become more powerful than what I can handle, and I will probably shut off my computer again and ruin my chance at ever having a place in this Lab.

755,Optimal-Ad-8563,Needs A Hug/Support,1,Anxiety,1625593255,"I hate when people tell me ""you're so perspective of your anxiety!"" Lots of people assume that if you're perceptive of your mental health issues, it means you're basically healthy and don't need much help. And when I say perceptive, I mean saying things like ""I know that what I'm anxious about isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. I know I'm not in any danger. But I'm still extremely distressed, and I still feel those emotions and feelings and thoughts as if they are reality."" 

It almost feels like you are awake and perceptive while having surgery. Aware of every single thing happening in your body, how its affecting you, and where it hurts. Imagine waking up during a surgery, saying ""I've been opened up, and hurt a fuck ton,"" and the surgeon just goes ""wow, very perceptive, you know alot for someone in your condition!"" Like, that's not what I'm looking for, please actually try to help and sew me the fuck up. 

I wish sometimes I wasn't so 'perceptive', as it then plays into my already massive mountain of guilt and shame. Yes, I know no one at this social function is going to shame me or harm me in a physical way. Yes, I know the vast majority of the time, there is truly nothing threatening in the dark. But I still get stressed in social situations, and I still can't sleep at night. Having these intrusive thoughts are apart of anxiety, a symptom, rather than a badge of courage to wear, and I wish it would be seen as that."

Since then, I have felt a ton of withdrawal symptoms. The worst one is severe depression, which does not seem to be letting up, and which I never in my life had before taking BuSpar. 

I am still taking 30mg/day with numerous side effects, but I am afraid of going down farther too quickly. My goal is to be off of the medication.

Besides seeing a therapist as well, something that I‚Äôve started practicing each day is a mantra or prayer, learning Buddhism, and meditation, which I think can all possibly help with anxiety (besides the obvious talking to people, etc.) There‚Äôs a book called Siddartha and several books from Eckhart Tolle that teaches how to be still.

The first week is always worst, im physically unable to do basically anything. I cant eat, drink, sleep or breathe and sometimes i cant even talk but as days go by it always improves as i start to trust my body again.

Yesterday it got triggered again and i had panic attacks all day long, i wanted to slit my wrists. But this time i called my therapy crisis line and we had a long talk about how autism needs security or else we go crazy. We'd rather hurt ourselves instead of be insecure. 

We made some points and how to deal with the anxiety, some extra medication and therapy and some ideas on what steps we can take to help me so i dont have to feel hopeless.

Right now im fairly calm again, im glad i took this step instead of hurting myself out of desperation."

Since then, I've been living with my parents the whole time (also because college was shut down due to covid). During this period, there was never a time when any of us ventured out of the town. I became closer to them.

But this week they are travelling to a church in the next state as my sister's B'Day's coming up and mom is a bit religious and she insisted. But I can't as I would be starting my internship. So I would be alone at my house for 4 days which is right smack dab in the middle of one of the hardest days for me.

I keep having these dark thoughts of anything bad that might happen to them. I can't seem to stop myself from letting go of the possible thought of becoming an orphan. This is bugging me so much. I have a bad case of separation anxiety as there have been cases in the last year where I had to resort to bodily harm.

My parents even offered to not go, but I realize this must stop. It cannot go on like this and also mom wanted badly to go. So in spite of keeping a smiling face, I'm screaming inside. Can't shake these horrible thoughts. Events leading to my sister's death keep popping up randomly thinking how the universe might repeat itself.

I need help. My financial conditions prevent me from keeping any therapist on the payroll. And also, the ones over here are horrible. So anyone please help me. This is a desperate cry. I can't seem to get any work done and this leads to me falling into the depression pit from which I worked so hard to recover from last year."

The last few weeks/months, I struggled more than I did the last 6-7 years. 

I thought I could will myself out of it. I thought booking a vacation for the end of July with my partner would fix it. That the summer would bring back my courage and ability to recover from my anxiety attacks. 

Well it did not. What is starting to do it is to let my need of being in control of my disorder and how it express itself in my life (work, relationship, friendships and family). I let my therapist offer things and I'm willing to try them. I told my work that I needed to have my hours reduced until my vacation, I told them I am struggling and admitting that was such a relief. 

So, this morning I was feeling kinda positive and thought, again, that I could will myself into being okay all day. 

And then my mother wrote me to tell me my little sister (11 years old) is in the hospital because she attempted suicide. 

Like my father before, my mother and myself. My family should have a membership to the mental health emergency room at this point. 

Well, my day won't be easy and I probably won't be able to recover from that and go back to the good mood I had when I woke up. 

It isn't my fault that I didn't succeed in being happy and calm today, and I need to repeat it until I believe it.

Some simply handed out homework and would tell us to figure it out. Some told us to not ask any questions unless someone was dying or they wanted to fail the assignment. Some grilled students so much to the point where they cried if they dared to say anything. 

I was never very outspoken but after that, I just shut up completely. 

So yeah, middle school majorly freaked me out. Every school was spend dealing with constant anxiety attacks and eventually I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. Nothing felt real. Nothing mattered. No matter happened I knew it was going to hurt so I stopped caring. I dissociated heavily throughout the day. 

I would usually wake up when I went home, horrified and panicked because I barely paid attention to any of the work I did in class. What assignment was due? What chapter did we read? How do I solve this problem again? Angry and scared I would spend the rest of the night trying to make up for the disaster of a day. I worked through dinner and cried myself to sleep. 

And the next day came and went. And I cried and struggled. Until eventually I gathered the courage to ask for help. I stayed after class and would ask how to do a problem, begged for any kind of guidance or if they could just spend more time working over this topic tomorrow.  

It didn‚Äôt work. 
They told me if I couldn‚Äôt understand the textbook then I should just give up. 

Desperate, I went with to mother and together we asked the teacher and they told us that I was just stupid and a lost cause. That they had students with potential to waste their time on. 

A part of me died there. I still tried to work, but the insults and the Fs didn‚Äôt hurt so much anymore. I still had a flash of hope when I managed to get an answer right before something else beaten it out of me. 

My mother moved me to a new school. And just like that, I was surrounded by wonderful teachers who cared for me, asked me about my day and did their best to accommodate me. I tried my best to make sure I never get to that level again and for the most part it worked, but college is made to push you to your limit. 

And I‚Äôve reached it. 

The harder things get, the more I struggle with keeping myself in the present. If I can focus, most of the time the work is manageable and sometimes easy. But some projects just seem extra daunting at first and I struggle with not dissociating. Lately I‚Äôve been losing days to this. 

And all of a sudden I‚Äôm struggling, choking down another anxiety attack, praying a panic attack doesn‚Äôt follow, struggling to force myself to ask for help, flinching every time I do, and unsuccessfully shaking away all of the intrusive suicidal thoughts. 

I‚Äôve recently gotten an anxiety medication and I‚Äôm trying to get something for my depression, but every day that slips by feels like another crack on my soul. It‚Äôs scary because for once in a long time, I don‚Äôt know how much more I can handle. 

I fought so hard until now and I haven‚Äôt given up yet, but I‚Äôm just so tired. So so fucking tired. 

I just want a break."

816,camelCaseComments,Recovery Story,2,Anxiety,1628756777,"How I beat a panic disorder  Problem: Post a traumatic fainting episode, for 12 months I always felt weird or sort of dizzy when walking. Like swaying on a boat. I suffered numerous panic attacks. Felt scared of leaving my house and was not interested in doing activities I loved otherwise. 

Progress: From being worried to walk on sidewalks or in grocery stores, I have now cycled myself to grocery stores, walked for hours on sidewalks, fearlessly boarded aircrafts and traveled to different cities, relocated to a new city and all is well. This required months of hard work on a personal front but I am so glad that I did it. I took no medicines in this entire journey. The only solution was to do what my therapist asked me to do. Replacing the automatic thought with alternate thought.

Summary: 

Below is a detailed description of this journey. I write details so that others who may be suffering with something similar may find hope and know they‚Äôre not alone. I will share some super helpful tips too that worked great for me. 

TLDR: First step is to meet your GP or certified counselor/therapist and get professional medical help and guidance. Identify the automatic thought that makes you feel anxious and repeat LOUD and CLEARLY to yourself the alternate thought. In my case, the alternate thought was ‚ÄúI am feeling dizzy and scared I will faint‚Äù which I replaced by saying out loud to myself ‚ÄúI am fine and it‚Äôs a normal bodily response. It will go away on its own. I am normal‚Äù. 

Incident: I (25 yo M) fainted while playing a sport on a hot summer afternoon. The fainting itself happened due to dehydration and a few precipitating factors such as overly anxious about certain life events. I remember suddenly having blurred vision, not remembering anything from a few seconds ago and unable to play. Within no time I was on the ground and I was very scared. However, I was immediately given water and hydration salts by people around me and I got up and walked all by myself again. NOT ONCE has anything like that happened again. However, unfortunately I kept feeling scared of fainting or falling down again for the next ONE YEAR. 

Reasons for precipitating anxiety: It was the summer of 2020, a pandemic year, and I was in the midst of major career events. I indeed had a lot of anxiety already but I never knew until my body actually had enough of it. Being dehydrated and playing in 90F temperatures just made it worse. 

Diagnosis: For the first 2 to 3 days after the incident, I didn‚Äôt play just to be fine. My doctor asked me several questions about any alarming symptoms and I had none. He concluded it was just anxiety and that I need to meet a counselor or therapist. Within a few days, while on an elevator, suddenly as soon as we reached the third floor, I was very scared and breathless. That‚Äôs when I decided to meet a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (CBT) who very quickly understood my problem. I will highlight some important things from that session:

Therapist: What triggered this?

Me: I explained everything I mentioned above.

Therapist:  What sensations do you feel?

Me: I feel like I will fall or faint again especially on hard surfaces. My breath becomes short and I feel tingling in my head that feels like being dizzy. 

Therapist: How much do you believe in these thoughts on a 0 to 100 scale right now?

Me: 80 to 90

Therapist: The automatic thought here is ‚ÄúWhat if I fall again?‚Äù This is what you are internally thinking and we call it an Automatic Thought.
Therapist: What evidence do you have to feel so?

Me: The symptoms I mentioned above make me feel so. 

Therapist: What evidence do you have against these thoughts?

Me: I have not fainted again. My health parameters are all normal. I am able to walk, run and play fine. 

Therapist: What is the worst thing that will happen if you fall?

Me: I will get up again. 

Therapist: Wonderful! This is your Alternate Thought. Remember, whenever you get an automatic thought, always counter it with a logical alternate thought.

I remember within just these 20 minutes of therapy, I felt alright. She asked me to go and walk on the sidewalk and I felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again after 7 days of unnecessary fear.

The only thing I had to remember was to practice CBT whenever I felt fearful. 

In the days and weeks to come, I practiced CBT both on paper and in my mind. But as soon as I went to play on hard surfaces, I again used to feel anxious/nervous. I tried hard to do the CBT as I did with my therapist but I was too fearful. In a way, the sensations I experienced were magnified by my fear. This lead me into the vicious anxiety cycle. Sensations produced anxiety. The anxiety produced more sensations. 

Soon I found myself talking to my therapist frequently and she spending hours on helping me. I used to feel very good after talking to her but not for long. I was becoming scared of very normal things like walking into a grocery store or being left alone in a coffee shop. Standing in the Starbucks or a Walmart queue used to be so fearful as an experience. Running on the treadmill also became a very dreadful experience. I was heavily depressed due to this nonstop fear I had to live with. I woke up everyday thinking hopefully I will feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù today.

I had been having very frequent panic attack and, it was clear I was having a panic disorder and needed regular therapy and desensitization exercises. My therapist kept asking me to go to the grocery stores, outdoors or play as I always used to. However, with Winter beginning in North America and of course lockdowns continuing everywhere due to the pandemic, it wasn‚Äôt easy. The next months were followed by several ups and downs in this journey of eliminating my anxiety disorder. However, it was also a very enlightening one. It taught me many things about myself. I found out the root cause of my anxiety. A lot of it was to do with my ego and perfectionist attitude. I understood myself better. I won‚Äôt go into those details right now but I highly encourage each one of you to do so with your therapist. 

Symptoms I felt:

1. Heart Palpitations
2. Dizziness/Swaying on a boat 
3. Feeling weird in the head
4. Hand muscles feeling very light or weak. 
5. Shortness of breath
6. Fear of walking outside house
7. Fear of panic attack outdoors
8. Catch in chest
9. Tingling in chest and arm pits

What helped me and tips which will help you too:

1. Talk to a medical professional: This is the first step. Get professional advice. Doctors often look for things that you won‚Äôt find online. Google search isn‚Äôt a substitute for this. It often is the worst thing you can possibly do and make your situation even worse than it is. Listen carefully to what your body is telling you and convey the same to your doctor. 

2. Know that you are absolutely fine: Yes, this is all that is there to know. Our mind for its beautiful mechanism of preparing for danger automatically, often produces a false positive response in harmless situations. This is an evolutionary benefit we humans have got. However, once your GP and therapist have said there is nothing to worry about, do not let your mind trick you into believing something else. In my case, if I didn‚Äôt feel panicky or dizzy while walking on grass / carpet but I did while on hard floor, does it make any sense? Clearly, it was anxiety. 

3. Say it out loud: ALL IS WELL. I AM FINE: I understand how frightening all the symptoms I mentioned above are since I have felt them all. BUT you need to know (and you really really need a lot of practice) that you should tell yourself LOUD and CLEAR: ‚ÄúTHESE ARE NORMAL SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY. I AM ABSOLUTELY FINE. I DON‚ÄôT NEED TO WORRY‚Äù. My therapist told me to do so right from the first session. However, it took me a while to believe that just by saying this I can be alright. Replace the automatic thought of ‚ÄúI feel dizzy or shaky so I must be having something wrong‚Äù with the alternate thought ‚ÄúI am fine. This is a normal bodily response. I am continuing with what I am doing‚Äù. Practicing this for just three days made me feel so normal again. It is very hard initially. I promise it gets better. 

4. Exposure therapy: Do those things which make you feel scared. Have a friend with you to help you out. I used to be scared of putting on a mask and going into a grocery shop. Why? Because my body used to produce an anxious response to the idea of being around others in an ‚Äúindoor‚Äù shop. So weird right? I had enough of it after 7 to 8 months. One day I told myself: ‚ÄúI am going to Walmart. On my own. I am going to wear a mask and shop as I usually did. If I fall, I will get up again. I am not going to worry about it. I am going to be okay if I fall. I won‚Äôt be embarrassed‚Äù. It‚Äôs funny but after that I never had any anxiety of going in a shop or a Walmart. 


Note: All points below are very helpful. However, if I didn‚Äôt practice point 2, 3 and 4, it didn‚Äôt help me to eliminate my fear of fainting or feeling dizzy while walking even if I followed all the points below. Addressing the automatic thought with an alternate thought is the only solution to eliminate the anxious response accompanying the automatic thought. Then why am I mentioning the points below? That is because they also helped me create a healthy lifestyle that I was lacking in the first place and which was the reason I was slowly but steadily building up anxiety over the years. 

5. Eat, Sleep &amp; Exercise: I used to write diaries as a school kid. I picked up all of the ones from 6th grade to 10th grade. I noticed a beautiful pattern. I always slept by 10:30pm and woke up by 6:30am. Even on weekends, I wasn‚Äôt breaking this pattern by more than 2 hours. I had a dedicated time for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every evening my friends and I spent 2 hours playing. How beautiful was it! Never in my school life I ever had any anxiety or panic problems. I decided to start this life again. And it slowly but steadily gave me very good results. Good food gave me good energy, exercising made me feel fresh and energetic. Sleeping for 8 hours made me fresh for the next day too. 


6. 9 to 5 work life: Set aside a fixed time for working, for sleeping, eating, family, exercise. Believe me, it works wonders. Having specific hours set aside for work and then for yourself or your family is a beautiful way to prioritize your time and take care of your health, both mental and physical. The pandemic forced so many to work from home and then it was common to hear stuff like ‚ÄúI am not working from home. I am living at work‚Äù. This is because you have not prioritized your time. Many ‚Äúinspirations‚Äù will tell you how a 9 to 5 job is bad and void of ambition. Do not listen to such nonsense. You have a personal life to look after. Nobody else will. Certainly the ‚Äúinspirations‚Äù won‚Äôt.

7. Meditate: I reserve 15 minutes every day after work at 5pm to meditate. All you need is some space in which you can relax and sit quietly for 15 minutes. It really helped me to refresh after working. Maybe meditating in the morning works for you. Or maybe before sleep. Do what suits you. 

8. Good vibes only: Surround yourself with good friends, relatives and family. Talk to them about your problems. When I say ‚Äúgood‚Äù, I mean the ones who won‚Äôt judge you and will support you. Play board games with them. Laugh with them. 

9. Look forward to something new: I began engrossing myself in activities like learning to cook new recipes at home, setting personal running records, painting, decorating my house interior and I found that whenever I did something new it had a beautiful feeling of satisfaction. This kept me feeling happy. Weekends are a time especially for this. 

10. Journal: Pen down your thoughts. They help us have so much clarity. Our minds produce automatic thoughts on a very involuntary basis. Write down what you think. This helps bring perspective. I used to feel that if I drank coffee at Starbucks I was becoming more anxious and panicky. But that didn‚Äôt make sense. I didn‚Äôt feel the same at home. Thus, I recorded everything from what I ate, when I ate, how much calories I burned, when I exercised, how much I exercised, when I slept etc. I found that there was no correlation between any of the above factors and my fear of falling down again. On days when I ate just 1500 calories, had 4 cups of coffee BUT still practiced point number 3, I had ZERO anxiety. But on days when I ate 2400 calories, exercised one hour, slept 8 hours BUT didn‚Äôt practice point 3, I was miserable. This reinforced my belief in practicing point number 3. Note that this didn‚Äôt mean I be careless about my health. But my main problem of ‚Äúbeing fearful of feeling dizzy‚Äù could only be addressed by saying ‚ÄúI am fine. This is a normal bodily reaction‚Äù. 

11. Love yourself: Be kind to yourself. Understand that we are humans. We all have problems. But we CAN solve them. All you are having is just a harmless bodily reaction that is magnified and thus terrifying. Treat yourself to simple victories. If you love yourself, the world will too. 

12. Be kind to the world: When I first felt petrified of standing in a queue at Starbucks, I realized that people around me didn‚Äôt even notice. The next time you try to be rude to someone or shout at them, know that they maybe battling something that you don‚Äôt even know. Be generous to the world around you. 


Here are some points which I dearly will request you to NOT DO: 

1. Alcohol / Smoke / Drugs: It‚Äôs a no brainer that these substances will only worsen your condition. I wasn‚Äôt ever drawn towards smoking or drugs so I never had any problems around those. I loved beer once a while but since I knew I was fighting a disorder, I didn‚Äôt drink till I was very sure that I am normal again. I still don‚Äôt drink more than once a month. 

2. Google Doctor: Do not research your symptoms. That will only tell your brain that you are not okay and it will inevitably produce stress chemicals that will give rise to anxiety and the vicious anxiety loop begins. Google searches often give you the worst possible diagnosis. Not sure of something? Call your doctor. Talk to them. There‚Äôs a reason why they study well into their 30s. Trust them. In my case, if I felt dizzy, I had to practice point 3 in the section above. Not google the causes for it.

3. Social Media: The pandemic opened the flood gates for so much anxiety producing content on the internet. People constantly posting depressing news through their stories or posts. Fighting and arguing about politics. You don‚Äôt need that. It doesn‚Äôt help. Unfollow / block any content that you feel is depressing or negative. 

4. Celebrity inspirations: You would have come across videos titled ‚ÄúInspirational / Motivational journey of Mr. X who founded company Y‚Äù. In that you would hear Mr. X say stuff like I worked all day and night. I didn‚Äôt take weekends off. I was determined to reach my goal. Only because I worked 100 hours a week I achieved them. DO NOT pay heed to such nonsense. This is the perfect recipe for building anxiety slowly over years only for it to come out very badly later on. As I said in point 5 in the previous section, good regulation of eating, sleeping and staying fit has a very important role to play in our lives. Sure, hard work will always help you. I myself have worked 14 hours at work. But that really is once in probably 6 months as we had a deadline to chase. And then that followed days of rest. Staying disciplined in life also is hard work in many ways. You would not hear online inspirational videos talking about the negatives of a perfectionist attitude. Besides, success has also come to those who lived just normal lives. There‚Äôs nothing cool about putting in 100 hours a week. Get over it. 

5. Negative people from your life. Seriously. Blocking out such people doesn‚Äôt make a difference to them. It shouldn‚Äôt make a difference to you either. It may come with costs such as ‚ÄúWhat will people say?‚Äù which are far cheaper than being victims of unhealthy relationships. Nobody cares about us honestly. Everyone has a life. And of course, everyone wants gossip. But that doesn‚Äôt have any significance. Even when you gossip about someone, you do it for your entertainment and move on. Similarly, when others do that to you, take it with a pinch of salt and move on. It doesn‚Äôt have any worth in your life or theirs.

6. Judgmental people: Unfortunately, there are enough people in our lives especially in family who will judge us for taking counseling or help. These are the same people who never have even thought they need help for decades altogether. Do not mess up your life because of them. You don‚Äôt need to tell them about your struggles.

818,ceinwyn15,Advice Needed,7,Anxiety,1628755298,"Dating mentally healthy people when you have anxiety/depression I (30 F) have been diagnosed with adhd and panic syndrome for about 7 years now. I think I deal with them pretty well, have been on therapy since the second attack and have tried several meds. Now I take vyvanse and qetiapine, and it's working well. I managed to live a pretty normal life (by putting a lot of effort) and am now doing my PhD. I can mask quite well. In the past, I always dated other sick people, because I felt understood, you know? The relationships never lasted because - as any sick people that dated other sick know- we pull each other down. There is a limited amount of energy and I was usually putting 80% of mine ( as the more functional one) on trying to aid recovery on the other side. That eventually led to me having things ""slipping"" Through the cracks. My last ex refused meds and basically was sleeping 15 hours a day, I was a nurse. In the end we broke up because he refused to do therapy and I couldn't keep the nursing forever. But I don't regret it, he is now on a recovery path and im very proud of him. 

My therapist always incentivised me to date healthy ""normal"" People. So I decided to give it a shot. I'm dating now my boyfriend (27m) for 1 year. He is a shy nerd and an overall great person. We never have fights, talk it out. I was very forward with my condition and gave him explanations, we watched videos together, a whole user manual ( including videos of how the medication works, the conditions, etc). He has been supportive, but as I said, I don't really need much support: when I have panic attacks I take my xanax and lay down, my adhd is medicated, I don't lash out when I'm anxious (I actually go silent for a few hours exactly not to lash out. He plays games meanwhile). The most supportive thing he does is to keep my agenda, because I'm very prone to forgeting things. So like doctors appointments and stuff. I'm an overall overachiever and am always showering him with gifts and affection, a practice I developed earlier to ""compensate"" for being sick. If you do enough, people will give you a pass

So, yesterday I was tired and had run out of my adhd meds. Anyone that takes them knows withdrawl is a bitch. My doctors appointment for a refil is today, due to a vacation, and I foolishly thought 1 day won't be a big deal(oh boy was I mistaken) . So I'm in the market, and my bf just got home from work. I feel the panic creeping up on me. It's been 7 years, panic is like an old friend to this point. I don't despair or cry, but I did get intense despersonalization and derealization to the point I was not sure where I am anymore. To those that don't experience it, it feels like you're in a dream, your body is being remote controlled and your environment is something disconected with you ( if my clothes would vanish and I'd be butt naked I wouldn't mind, because I'm disconected) I call it aquarium head. So I hit him up on messenger and asked if he could come with my xanax and to pick me up, because I was walking in beelines already. The market is 3 blocks from our apartment. 

He replied to me: ""not happily but I will go""

Honestly, I know it's a little thing. I'm fully aware that having to get out of the house after you just arrived is an inconvenience. But that's exactly why I never wanted to date the healthy. I don't want to feel like an inconvenience. Feeling sick is bad enough, I don't need to add feeling guilty to the list. That one line kinda destroyed me. One benefit of dating the sick is that, when shit is tough, we are there for each other. Doesn't matter if it's 2am, or shit got so bad you need. To go to the emergency ( and thats a 8 hour wait sometime). We show up because we fucking know under our skin how awful it is. You have a bad day, no need to clarify, explain, bring up articles. 

That one line honestly broke my trust in him. All I could think is if this already makes him feel like I'm a burden, imagine if I have a bad month? Now I'm literally at my best, ever. My biggest fear in this hole dating healthy thing is that the healthy will just get tired and leave me, and I will be invested. I told him that before. He apologized for it but honestly I can't shake the feeling that this was his ""true"" Position and the rest is edited, because he loves me. But I've been in plenty of relationships, this is exactly the type of thing that erodes relationships.

I didn't fight him, I just explained to him basically the same I said now. He said we will talk home so I don't ""misunderstand"" Him more. What annoyed me. It was pretty clear, I'm not stupid. 

Anybody has any similar experiences? How did you deal with healthy/sick relationships? Do you have any guilt regarding your mental illness? Healthy people, is it a burden for you? Am I being crazy?."

821,No_Goat_1395,Venting,0,Anxiety,1628755096,"Venting about crippling social anxiety Don't really know what I want from this post, so I guess its really just to vent. Also a throw-away for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, I (24/M) have had social anxiety since my early teen years, probably as a response to being the 'immigrant' kid and not fitting in immediately to a new culture. But either way, here I am. My anxiety manifests primarily through avoiding any opportunity for rejection, both in personal and professional life. When I got rejected from my top choice university, I had such a severe depression I had a really bad depressive bout, when I first started looking for jobs and got an interview that didn't result in an offer, I couldn't bring myself to look for jobs and decided to go to grad school (I had good enough grades to continue a grad program at my school without needing to apply). The latest bout is down to realizing that I'm now in my mid 20's and seeing so many of my friends get engaged or start their lives and I've never really been in a serious relationship because I'm too afraid to seek it (in fact the only time I've been intimate with a girl is when I was severly drunk, which eases my anxiety, ofcourse the problem with being drunk is that you sober up, and a drunk me is an infinitely better, confident, funnier, and charming person than sober me). I don't mean to sound like an incel, and I don't blame anyone for my problems but myself (in fact I think I've convinced myself that I'm not worthy of love), and it really isn't about sex for me as it is about my fear of dying alone. Trying Tinder has only made it worse as I rarely get any matches (which only worsens my self image as I'd like to think that while not a male model by any means, I don't think I'm a slouch either) and even when I match my anxiety rarely allows me to make the first move. In fact my most recent match only threw me for a spin as after talking to this girl for a day and everything going well we decide to meet up, only for her to hit me with a 'background check' site that is an obvious scam (and I spent hours trying to convince myself its not only to find 10 other reasons to believe that it is, because I'm that pathetic). Admittedly I have a personality of a rubber flip flop (something that I'm trying to fix) as I have worked hard over the years to purge myself of any personality trait that I think might be seen as weird by anyone for any reason. I have tried therapy with limited success (in part because I'm afraid of what my therapist will think of me), though it has led me to try and 'reverse' some aspects of my anxiety (like trying to not hide my personality). And while I have friends I'm afraid of showing this side of me because I still deep down think that they don't actually like me very much and just tolerate me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, sorry for the long rambling post, but I just needed to get it out, as I really don't have anyone to talk to that I would trust to actually tell them the full story, so screaming into the void helps probably. I apologize for the self-loathing."

I got rid of it by quitting all caffeine consumption.  I still can't believe how well it fixed my issue.  I did not do it cold turkey since many advise the withdrawals are brutal.  IMO, you only have to taper it down for a week or so.  I went from coffee to green tea then decaff green tea.  I felt so much better when I was in the decaff stage.  I hope this helps because I know how it feels. I promise caffeine is making the anxiety way worse.    Also, you have to eat clean and exercise and work on getting good quality sleep.

I had severe insomnia as a kid, and I‚Äôd be up all night shaking because I was convinced I was dying and going to hell because of how horrible I felt.

Here‚Äôs the issue‚Ä¶ my panic attacks don‚Äôt last the average 20 minutes. I would do ANYTHING to make them that short. Instead, they‚Äôre 3-4 hours of shaking, heaving and being convinced I‚Äôll die. It‚Äôs as if my body randomly dumps 100x more adrenaline than normal into my blood for no reason at all. They don‚Äôt get easier. I‚Äôve had thousands, no joke, and they never get better.

I‚Äôve been medicated over ten years and I have periods where my anxiety is almost gone and periods where it‚Äôs horrible. About a year ago I had a massive seizure (doctors have no clue why) and now I have an extreme phobia of having a seizure again. So every time I feel ‚Äúweird‚Äù I panic even harder. With panic disorder you usually have no trigger, and I‚Äôve had no real triggers my whole life until the seizure.

This seemed to have sparked a huge issue of having to know where my cats are located at all times. About 9 times a day at least I randomly stop what I‚Äôm doing, and walk around the house and look in the three usual spots that they will be in. (I call this the ‚Äúcat count‚Äù) 

If i don‚Äôt find them after looking in the three places, my anxiety immediately shoots up and i begin panicking and get my poor boyfriend and/or my roommate to help me find them. Of course they‚Äôre always safe, but it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. 

As well, if i‚Äôm about to leave i do a cat count, lock all doors and windows so they can‚Äôt escape, and i pet each one in case i don‚Äôt see them again.

Even if i‚Äôm watching a movie, and a cat in the movie dies, it immediately triggers a panic attack. Or if i see a stray i get freaked out because i think about it getting hurt.

I've gone through times where it's better and worse.  Right now I'm going through the worst time ever anxiety wise for me.  It started in January. I started getting panic attacks again after my Dad was diagnosed with cancer.  He made it through but my level of anxiety stayed.  Then I started having physical symptoms like throat closing, constipation, diahrea, knots in my belly, can't breath.  I went  to my doctor and had a full physical.  Everything came back normal.  I kept asking the doctors for more tests and I've had them all.  I had thyroid tests, CBC, CRP, ESR,  Stool tests, IBD panel, CT Scan of my Abdomen, I even had a colonoscopy. All came back normal.  I can't stop thinking I have an awful disease that's causing my symptoms and no amount of negative tests help alliivate the fear.  My anxiety causes GI issues and then I get all anxious about getting anxious.  Yesterday I think I ate something bad and it gave me awful symptoms and it just makes my health anxiety 100x worse.  It's a vicious circle.  I'm starting to be afraid to leave my house and I'm even anxious at home so there's no where for me to go to calm down.  I'm taking Klonopin but that doesn't really help. I am seeing a counselor every week.

I've also had so many changes in my life.  My dad got sick, my wifes job almost relocated so there was stress of moving, the house we lived in we rented and was being sold so we had to find a place to live, I bought a new house, I lost my job, i think I'm having identity issues, so many things at once.

I advanced a great deal since i was a teen, back then i couldn't speak to a stranger and i would've been paranoid all the time. 

But now after all that time i still rely on food, impulsive purchasing,  video games, Netflix and board games to be happy and not depressed. But this undermines my own ability to learn and get better and possibly a job in IT.

I feel anxious most of the time especially when walking down the street to work by myself i have an eerie sensation of unknown and i feel like i am in a strange place that i do not know. When in reality i walked that street for a year now and i am very familiar with.

904,Calltheseacaptain,Health,0,Anxiety,1631915843,"In a cycle that I don‚Äôt know how to break For a little over 3 years I (32F) have been symptomatic with chronic brain fog, constant tension headaches and cognitive issues that include memory loss, trouble focusing and thinking straight, and putting words together (even basic words).

I‚Äôve had high functioning anxiety for about 7-8 years but generally had a good sense of self up until the cognitive issues knocked my confidence.

I can‚Äôt be 100% certain the symptoms above are all anxiety related - I get dizzy too along with blurred vision and unrefreshed sleep but they definitely contribute to feelings of anxiousness. I have Hashimoto‚Äôs and IBS which are also known to link to cognitive issues, something to consider. 

The reason this is such a vicious cycle is because the symptoms make it very difficult to make conversation or keep conversation going, I get frustrated with myself when I am struggling to retrieve words or memories and form basic sentences, so much so that I feel embarrassed when I talk. 

It feels like the symptoms attribute to the anxiety, which in turn *may* be causing/worsening the symptoms and I am stuck in this cycle where I don‚Äôt know who I am any more and I‚Äôm so desperate to connect with people but when I do I feel awful because I didn‚Äôt do ‚Äòa good job‚Äô, whether it was because I couldn‚Äôt add anything to the conversation, get my words out or even take in what the other person was saying to me.

This past year it has been noticeably worse and contributed to the breakdown of my 7 year relationship. Working from home was pretty awful boxed in a room with someone I couldn‚Äôt talk with very well, only to see people so much younger than me be able to communicate with my ex. I was heartbroken and began comparing myself to them and feeling totally unworthy of love.

I am currently studying at university but I don't really like the course and I don't know nearly as much as my coursemates and feel out of my depth. Alot of my anxiety I think stems from these uncertainties and also my future and what exactly I will do with my life. Each year I get older it only gets worse as I know I am capable of being a driven and ambitious person when I want to be, as I have gotten into working out and trained hard every single day since and dieted. I also record alot of music and have taught myself different instruments. 

I am going back to uni tommorow to start my second year so these anxious feelings are coming back stronger. My ADHD makes it hard too as I struggle to keep on top of everything physically and mentally, it also makes it harder for me to absorb uninteresting information so I struggle to catch up on my course. 

I have made alot of positive changes that have improved my mental health massively, I no longer have depression symptoms or extreme anxiety so I feel like this is the last piece of the puzzle really.

 Has anyone here got any tips to getting over this inherent anxiety that I have regarding the future? And also anyone dealing with ADHD aswell? I feel like I am capable of big things but I am still being weighed down and not actually truly ""enjoying"" life. Thanks"

I had considered asking about medication for a few years but felt I could just continue to power through until last year. Thanking my husband who encouraged me to seek out help.

I have had anxiety for my entire life. It progressively got worst as I aged. It was always there, but I would go through really bad episodes. In the last 2-3 years though it got really bad. I did therapy, and I had always been able to push through though it was terrifying and exhausting. Last year I took a turn for the worst. Changes in my career (plus a pandemic didn't help) lead me to setting up an appointment with my GP to ask about medication. I was just so tired at this point. I knew I couldn't go on like this for the rest of my life. I cried and hyperventilated in the exam room so I didn't think she needed much convincing. 

She put me on fluoxetine daily and hydroxyzine as needed. It took a few months for me to feel the affects but by 5-6 months oh boy let me tell you these things are MIRACLES! I'm actually able to function. I can deal with situations without breaking down or have my mind spiral out of control. 

I've had 3 huge presentations at work the past month. I had some nerves but NOTHING and I mean NOTHING compared to how I would have been like a year ago. I feel like I'm blossoming.

I‚Äôm just so scared. It‚Äôs so much easier to forget I need to apply for jobs. In the past, I struggled so hard filling out applications because they triggered my self hatred. Even now, it's cumulative because I feel increased shame for being the age I am now (23) with so little experience.

930,reading_hermit,Needs A Hug/Support,0,Anxiety,1631909516,"My First Time Reaching Out So this is my first time posting here (and my first thread on reddit) and as you can guess, I have anxiety. I'm a 31 year old dude and I haven't been formally diagnosed with anything, but I'm assuming I have GAD and previously had Panic Disorder, which I assumed was the case because of the many panic attacks I would have per day (for years), but I managed to recognize when they were about to happen and got (apparently) so good at stopping them that I was panic free for *years* but still had the underlying issue that caused the disorder in the first place.

I'm reaching out because it feels like it has reached a breaking point, especially these last few days. For a little background, almost a month ago, I had a panic attack as a result of my heart rate suddenly increasing. Now, previously, my panic was entirely centered around a fear of throwing up so its been quite a while since I've experienced heart-related anxiety, and *that* kind of anxiety--the kind that happened almost a month ago made my anxiety skyrocket to the point that now, it takes me forever to go to sleep and when I do, I abruptly wake up 3-4 hours later feeling stressed and with an elevated heart rate.

Now, it hasn't led to panic attacks, but between physical stress from overtraining with HIIT (I assume, can't confirm), sleep deprivation, and this nagging *feeling,* this fear that I have for the next bout of anxiety which makes me feel overwhelmed, this impatience where I want it to end now (not as in suicide) is getting to me. I already set up an appointment as a new patient for a therapist, but its on the 24th of September so this impatience is partly affected by that.

In short, (because I'm writing this exhausted and stressed and unable to go to sleep) the hypochondria-related anxieties have more or less disappeared, but now I just feel...the dread and nothing more. Like, I recently took 200mg of L-Theanine from Suntheanine and well, I certainly *feel* different. Like, I should be having all of the typical symptoms of anxiety, but all I have is that sense of dread, of being physically overwhelmed by the mental feeling, if that makes sense. So I'm assuming it works because normally this kind of worrying would be giving me panic attacks yet I'm just...like SUPER stressed instead.

I suppose the main reason why I'm posting this is just to have someone to talk to as due to my past of neglect and abuse, I *literally* have no friends that I can just...call and lean on their shoulder if you know what I mean, and my mother (my father passed) is someone who is the source of my neglect and abuse so I suppose maybe this is more of a nervous breakdown? I don't know, a lot of the stuff I read online seem vague to me (but maybe that's just because I'm a philosopher so I need terms to be *defined* lol). Like, my anxiety is just a wicked cocktail of loneliness, stress about my novel which is--like--my reason for living, and of course, stress over if I'll be able to ever get another good night's sleep again. I know thoughts like that last bit are *extremely* unhelpful, but that's exactly what my anxiety makes me feel.

I don't know, I'm ranting I suppose, and I guess I just needed someone to talk to? Either way, if you've read this, thanks for reading! I'll be happy to answer any questions of course!"

It seemed like the store doesn't get a lot of business except for the free events they hold on the weekends (adventurers league, magic tournaments, etc.) And I thought, hey, I'll be coming here a lot, I really want this place to do well since there aren't many stores like this in the area (much less 5 minutes from my house), and I'm lead developer on a project that could get them a lot more business! 

I have ADHD on top of my anxiety and other things, so I take Adderall daily to help with that. One thing it does, however, is make me A LOT more outgoing while it's in my system than I normally am. So in conversation with one of the owners, I mentioned that I could probably get them involved with the program. I also told them that I didn't think it costs anything to enroll, which was dumb of me in hindsight. I'm just the app developer and didn't really have any notion as to the business side of the program, and found out that yes, of course it costs money to enroll. So they seemed really excited to get involved, I bought some cards, and then I left.

Later on when I requested info on how to enroll from the main guy at the University, he sent me some forms for them to fill out. Right there on the front page was a pretty large enrollment cost and I immediately started feeling bad about it. I had gotten them all excited and now I was going to drop off forms that say the opposite of what I told them which is disappointing for them, and makes me look like I just came in to sell something.

I dropped the forms off anyway (Adderall), and bought something else out of guilt while I was there. This was about a month ago. Well today the lead guy for the program asked me if they were thinking about signing up after I had told him about them. I told him I was pretty sure they hadn't followed up because they're a very small business and probably can't afford the fee. He then told me that he would give them a discount due to the fact that I'm the one who found them, and that they could pay the fee in monthly installments. So I thought, wow, this is awesome! And then I started overthinking it.

I feel like it looks incredibly sleazy of me to keep bringing this up to them. Think about it. I show up one day out of the blue, mention offhand that I can get them a kickback without bringing up any kind of cost to them, then come in with a form that does indeed have a big price on it. And now if I go back after a month (haven't had the time or money to go there in a while) and say hey I can get you a discount and you can pay monthly for membership, it just looks like I'm only ever coming in there to badger them about joining something and paying money. The thing is I get absolutely no money out of this if they do join, and I'm sincerely just trying to help a business I care about. I just don't want to look like an asshole used car salesman to these nice people and have no clue what to do. My wife keeps telling me my anxiety is making me overthink it and she's right, but it's making my anxiety so much worse to the point that I don't even want to go into the store to shop.

If you read that whole thing you're a saint and I'd love some advice on how to handle this.

TL,DR: trying to help a local business I really like, but don't want to come off as though I'm trying to be pushy and only trying to sell them something."

956,AnalogDreams-,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1631903724,"Mental trick for reducing anxiety Hi all, just wanted to share something that usually gives me noticeable relief when I'm feeling really anxious. For me, a lot of my anxiety manifests in overthinking, ruminating, worried about the future. Worried about my worrying. So much self-help info out there is based around regulating your nervous system, challenging thoughts, achieving ""mindfulness."" And this is all great, I'm into it. But sometimes the effort to become more peaceful feels the exact same as anxiety rumination - needing to transform into something other than what I am to reduce anxiety, to ""fix"" myself. 

The past few weeks have been rough for me, but something simple popped into my head a few days ago that immediately provided a sense of relief. It was: ""I am at peace with my lack of peace."" I didn't realize how much of my anxiety was about this pressure to fix and improve myself. This counterweight is about me giving myself a break, essentially. Just wanted to share, hopefully someone else can give themselves a break too."

I am always in a mental rush to finish whatever I'm doing. If I'm reading, I skip sentences to go faster. If I have a long work to deliver for my job, I need to do a quick overview of everything, so I have at least an idea of what I have to do in each cycle, otherwise I cannot stop and focus and wait to learn later the rest of the details.

I believed them, went home and the pain went away. Then my anxiety started talking to me...what if they were wrong? They might have missed something...let's go check with my actual doctor. Fast forward to now and my doctor has told me the same thing. My vitals are fine, my heart sounds good and my circulation is good. I'm at no risk for a heart attack. I believe him...for a while. Now this week and the last, I've been having arm numbness, and I went back to my doctor last Friday, he ran the tests again, and they all came out fine. He asked me if I wanted him to refer me to a cardiologist for a second opinion, and I said yes because at this point, I have no idea what it's gonna take for my health anxiety to go down. I'm always so scared of having a heart attack because I have so many things I still wanna do and I think about how my folks would react if I did die and it freaks me out even more.


 If you got this far, thanks for listening to my rant. I'm just so tired of feeling like this, the anxiety and all that. I need a nap lol"

I feel hungry, but I don't want to eat because I'm afraid to feel full and bloated and maybe sick to my stomach. So I eat as little as possible to satisfy my hunger. And usually I end up still feeling a little hungry after, yet still full. I've lost a lot of weight over years slowly riding the up and down mental rollercoasters of anxiety and depression. 
If I'm too afraid, I don't eat. If I'm too down, I don't eat. If I'm too upset or too occupied or too stressed, I put off eating anything. 

Ontop of it, I can only eat a select amount of specific things due to stomach sensitivities like lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity, and salt sensitivity. 
Most food around has cheese or milk or salts or wheats in them, and so as a result I panic and despair that there is nothing for me to eat that is safe. I turn to eating either small snacks. Or I give in and hurt my digestion by filling myself up on breads and sweets and things. 

:( I hope the dietitian can help me out...I feel like I'm out of control and I am starting to get so thin I might dissappear..."

Like your body is so anxious all the time that once the anxiety is removed then it leaves you with what was underneath - a desperately tired body. I hadn't had wine in years, but had some twice recently. Didn't have very much each time.

When it kicked in, I just got so *tired.* Like my body finally let go of (most) of my anxiety and revealed the true state of my body. Tiredness. Exhausted from fighting the anxiety all the time.

I even took a nap and woke up for the first time in years - refreshed.

Of course I will not start drinking as a thing, unhealthy habit to have. 

But maybe I will occasionally when I'm at the end of my rope. Just a cup of wine. That's all it takes.

Great communication, great chemistry, we've been talking about moving in together and everything has been going so smooth between the two of us. Last night, however, we were laying in bed and both looking at his phone because we are going on a cruise in a little over a week and were looking on amazon at things we might need to get. A message from facebook popped up from some random guy just saying ""U horny?"". He seemed unbothered by it and just said ""oh my god, what??"" and then swiped it away. I instantly tensed up and felt like everything was crumbling. He then just kept scrolling through amazon like it hadn't just happened. I brought it back up and told him I was really bothered by that, who is this guy and why would he be messaging my boyfriend that he's horny at midnight? He just said it was some guy who had added him a while back and messaged him recently just saying hi, he didn't even know who it was, and now was randomly messaging him this. He pulled up the message and showed me that the conversation and there was nothing more than a ""hi"" and ""how are you?"" back and forth a few days ago, and then this random ""u horny?"" message. He deleted and blocked the guy and that was it. A few mins later he was in the bathroom and just said ""that is still bothering you isn't it"" and I said ""yes, of course it's bothering me, but if you are telling me that there is nothing to be worried about then I have no reason not to believe you"" and he said there wasn't anything to worry about. He got back into bed and was being extra attentive, cuddly and affectionate. I'm just struggling because he really has given me no reason not to trust him up to this point, but in the back of my mind I can't shake the feeling like I'm being an idiot and not sure I pressed the issue hard enough.

I have a huge fear of meds after trying Celexa and Klonopin 6 years ago. I have been prescribed 2 SSRI's but I can't take them because of the fear of what Celexa did to me so my doctor prescribed Busiprone 10mg 2x a day. I took 5mg last night to try it out after I tried one of the SSRI's 2 nights ago and felt like I was dying. 
It was weird, feeling so calm, and it did help me to feel better after the initial ""sedated"" feeling went away. I was actually able to sleep a little better than I have the past 2 nights but I kept waking up hour after hour like there was something I needed to do and I kept forgetting what it was. Easy to push away and go back to sleep but still not necessarily enjoyable.
Today I feel HORRIBLE. Like I am extremely hung over or physically sick. I feel like I dont have the energy to even breathe now. I have nausea, exhaustion, a headache...is this the Buspirone or something else? I have a UTI and a possible ear infection but I haven't felt this bad until after taking the Buspirone.
I havent taken another 5mg of the Buspirone because I have the tendency to dissociate and I don't want it to make that worse.

My 2nd time putting in a claim was the 18th, I have yet to see anything and it states ""No payment"" under status. tl;dr I am freaking out here. I have tried to reach the unemployment people, but thats nearly impossible.  I'm all but out of food, and unsure if this damn unemployment deposit will come through.

One time after we drank some cocktails she was gushing about how she thought i was a great guy and she loves my book (i'm writing some books) and so on... but she became all awkward and pretended not to remember the next morning.

but i'm tired of it, it's obvious she likes me more than she pretends and we could actually go somewhere, but she cant admit it.  instead she does the opposite and is sort of rude almost.  its simply projection.  

anyway i have decided to tell her that I'm done with the casual thing.  I'm not going to ask for a relationship, but i am open to it if she actually cares enough to fight for it - obviously with lots of discussion and negotiation.  After my last experience I am far more wary of red flags and so on now.

i'm writing here cos i'm really anxious about it and i want to get it off my chest.  i've done breakup chats before in the past, but not since i really developed anxiety (thanks, ex gf!).  the thing is i'm not afraid of the conversation, i'm just freaked out by *how to get there*

we are meeting tomorrow evening to watch movies.  i really just dont know when to bring things up... i'm considering sending her a message before hand saying something like ""just so you are not blind-sided, i want to talk to you about our situation when you get here"", because it seems unfair to have her over with the expectation of watching movies together and then just be like ""oh yeah btw..."".  Normally we'd discuss who would get snacks and stuff beforehand, and i would feel like a dick letting her go and buy things and come over, only to drop the hammer on her.  It's so awkward having to invite some over just so you can break up with them.

but warning her in advance also makes me fuckin anxious.  even just thinking about the walk from the front door of my building back to my flat is playing on my mind.  how awkward??  and she'll be wondering what i want to talk about until she arrives.

i am so bad at asserting my feelings, i just feel stupid and embarrassed about it.  i constantly second guess whether i've got unreasonable expectations (which i sort of do since we agreed that we're only casual) and am being too anxious or needy.  I am pretty sure if this girl turned around and said she loved me, then I would start being the one keeping her at a distance.

i'm so confused because when we meet up she acts so much like a girlfriend, but when we're apart it's like pulling teeth to see her again.  i asked her about it a while back and she said she keeps everyone at a distance, and once while we were drunk i opened up to her about something and invited her to share back and she told me that she was ""so scared of being vulnerable"".  she's slowly inched closer to me but as i said, as soon as she gets too close she just backs off and deliberately does/says something to imply that i'm not important.  i know it's bullshit and i've even told her as much but she isn't ready to accept her issues yet i think

Then for a couple months, we were doing this half-in-office and half-out-of-office schedule, but in a couple weeks, I need to return to the office full-time and I am DREADING it.

My anxiety while being in the office has gotten worse over time. When I first started my job, I was very friendly with everyone. I mean, I still am. For example, any time I pass someone out in the hallway or in the restroom/kitchen area, I always say hello and try to make a little conversation. 

But lately, I‚Äôve been struggling. I feel like everyone hates me. I hide in my office. I struggle to say hello to people as they walk by my office. It feels unnatural to me to shout, ‚Äúgood morning!‚Äù or ‚Äúhi!‚Äù from inside my office as someone walks by.

I duck down behind my computer if I hear footsteps. If I can work up the courage to look up from my desk, sometimes I wave and open my mouth to say something and nothing comes out but a whispered, ‚ÄúHey‚Äù. Or I say hello and wave but the person walking by doesn‚Äôt see me.

Now it seems like people walk by my office quickly with their heads down or turned the other way. I think I make people uncomfortable. I know it‚Äôs my fault and that makes it worse. I try to speak up but I just can‚Äôt get myself to.

I feel like everyone thinks I‚Äôm a rude bitch when really, I‚Äôm anxious every single minute that I‚Äôm in the office. I over analyze everything. Paranoid that people are talking crap about me. Paranoid that the higher ups hate me. Paranoid that I‚Äôm going to get fired for somehow creating a negative workspace because I have a hard time speaking up and greeting people as they walk by my desk.

38 F, 5'9"", 145 pounds,  white, past-smoker (on and off), social drinker, no outstanding health concerns, last check-up and bloodwork (normal) was in August.

Meds: multivitamin, vitamin C, vitamin D, Prozac (60 mmg/daily), Klonopin (1 mg/daily PRN), Trazodone (100 mg PRN)


So, I should say that I‚Äôve had panic attacks in the past that were bad enough to impact basic functions like walking and driving.

 This morning when dropping my son off at school, I became short of breath while walking back to my car, I also felt slightly dizzy, and cold, and I began to sweat.  I also started to feel this way as we walked up to the building.  I was totally fine prior.  My neck, shoulders, and arms also felt sore and stiff (but I could fully move all).  I also had a feeling of heartburn.

I attempted to drive for a few miles, but I started to dry heave in the car, which relieved some of the chest discomfort.  I had to pull over in the car and lie down.

I was freezing, felt odd (tingly), and very sweaty.  After about 15 minutes, I began to well enough to drive and went home.  Once at home my temperature was 95.9, and about 4 hours later is 97.7.  I am also feeling much better, but still slightly odd.  

Could this have been a panic attack?"

And I lost two best friends (had to cut them off because they were toxic)

This is also the year I quit my job to pursue being a comic book creator. 
All of this has given me really terrible anxiety which I take care of by journalling, and performing activities like taking walks, and playing guitar. I also watch a few channels like Thich Naht Hanh which help.

However I fall into this repeated pattern every day, where my days are filled with anxious thoughts, about everyone I've lost, and a really horrible searing pain manifests itself in my chest. Sometimes doing an activity that takes my attention from it makes it go away.

I (16F) have always been somewhat shy and reserved but I noticed when I was around 14 I started to develop a lot of anxiety which I think potentially stemmed from parental issues- grew up in a home with a lot of parental issues and had a lot of conflict with my mother. Since the pandemic begun I've noticed that my anxiety has increased tenfold - including a development of social anxiety and OCD, as well as several bad phobias including a fear of surgery/invasive medicine and the dark.

Especially concerning the surgical anxiety, I experience such horrible medical anxiety that even hearing about some one else's wisdom teeth surgery spirals me into hours of severe panic and hours of reaching, searching for a way out of my upcoming one. This phobia is so severe that hearing the phrase ""wisdom teeth surgery soon"" has even reuslted in me failing a test due to a panic attack. My anxiety is so heightened that I have experienced symptoms like heart palpitations, high blood pressure, and vomiting. I worry about everything especially the sedation aspect, medications, dignity with the hospital gown and healing process, complications... etc.

Nothing seems to work. I talked to medical professionals, many people who had the surgery recently, online help forums etc- I've heard hundreds of success stories and how it won't be so bad but nothing seems to work. I just feel more anxiety with each one. I've read countless ""preparing for your surgery/what to expect"" posts from oral surgerons. I've seen countless videos showcasing what to expect. Nothing will help me. I want to be helped but I almost feel like my brain is refusing help.

Is there anything I could do to lessen such a severe phobia- I've exhausted my options and I feel so much stress and anxiety that it affects me physically. I've even had fleeting thoughts of ripping out the IV or fleeing the hospital. If surgery has to be an option- which my parents are insisting it has to be- I really don't know what to do."

I don't know what it is, but I haven't had a good night's sleep in a very long time. I could sleep 8-9 hours but still feel pretty groggy when I wake up. I don't have bad eating habits and I am just slightly overweight. I have tried taking different kinds of sleeping pills, but I could never actually get a reinvigorating night of sleep. I usually wake up mentally exhausted; sometimes I feel like my brain is begging to sleep but my heart is pounding as to wake up me up. 

I used to think that this is due to (1) my low testosterone and (2) some form of sleep apnea. The low testosterone has been treated for over a year now, so I don't think that's the issue. The sleep apnea was ruled out when I went to get a sleep test done. 

At this point, I am pretty sure that my lack of good sleep stems from my anxiety and perhaps my ADD. When I take Adderall, I feel relaxed and all of the noise is gone from my head that I actually become a bit sleepy. 

Would anyone have suggestions as to what to do? Maybe there is a specific medication, supplement, or even exercise regimen that has helped my fellow redditors in the past?

1044,easypeasylucky,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1603473576,"Client Causing Stress and Anxiety I‚Äôve been working with a certain client for almost 5 years now. This client has been mostly great, to be honest. She referred me to a lot of her colleagues and has been grateful for what I‚Äôve been doing for her.

Recently, however, we started becoming quite close and our conversations would go beyond consultation hours.

I understand that I should set stronger boundaries, but it has reached the point where she has become very comfortable with me. Knowing how sensitive she could be, it‚Äôs been difficult for me to set limits with her. Recently, I‚Äôve been anxious about our interactions.

As a consultant, I‚Äôd advise her to do things that would be beneficial for her work. Lately she‚Äôs been stubborn and would straight out say she doesn‚Äôt want to follow my advice. She just wants to be right. When she‚Äôs not right, she shuts down. Unlike my other clients who pay in advance, she‚Äôd often make late payments too.

My practice has grown since I first met her and how she transacted with me hasn‚Äôt changed. Adjusting to my new system is not something she‚Äôd be willing to do, I‚Äôm afraid. (One time, she was embittered when a business owner asked her to course her orders through her new business website. My client didn‚Äôt like that because as a regular client, she wanted to be served personally by the owner though this person‚Äôs business has grown so much. I fear that she‚Äôs react the same way with me if I asked her to follow my system.)

I understand that I‚Äôm partly to blame for allowing her to get too comfortable with me and for not being firm with my boundaries. Unlike my other clients, it has been difficult for me to make her follow my requirements too. I got so used to giving her special treatment because I‚Äôve gained so much from her and I‚Äôm grateful for the things she has done for me and my practice. Now it‚Äôs difficult to draw boundaries.

Sometimes I feel like she just wants me to make her feel good about her decisions that my job is practically useless. When she‚Äôs unhappy about my advice that goes against what she wants to do, I often end up feeling anxious about it. But I know my job is to give her the advice she needs, not the one she wants.

I honestly feel stressed and disrespected when she doesn‚Äôt pay on time given all the adjustments I make for her. My messages get ignored for days that I‚Äôd have to send her multiple messages.

I know this is a challenge that can be fixed and I should talk to her about this. I‚Äôm wondering though: have you experienced the same thing with your clients? How did you handle it?"

Usually I would just politely make a white lie up, something like feeling nauseous or having already eaten, so that they didn't feel like I was declining it because of them.

I've noticed that this has extended into my adult life as well. Just a few moments ago this happened which prompted me to make this post.

At work, a coworker in a different department came to me saying that they ordered a pizza but there was a slice left that they wanted to offer me before they threw it out.

1048,DavidTheSlouch89,Advice Needed,2,Anxiety,1603472194,"Overthinking the past I've been dating my girlfriend for 5 months now.  We actually dated for a couple months last year as well, broke up for half a year, and eventually got back together.  We're both 16 for the record.

She has mental illnesses and had a really fucked up childhood.  As a result of abuse and general heartbreak, she did many drugs and other bad things before she knew me.  

Since we got together again, she has cleared up her act.  She hasn't done a drug for months, and I have full confidence she won't do any again.

That's not the problem, however.  I find myself overthinking literally every single day about her past and the stories she told me.  It terrifies me.  The thoughts never seem to stop.

She does just about everything in her power to help me out. We talk about it and she does her best to reassure me, but as we know with anxiety, someone simply telling you it's gonna be ok doesn't exactly do the trick. 

So I'm asking for advice on how to cope with this.  Maybe an explanation on what exactly it is I find myself dealing with? Any help or input is appreciated."

1058,BigDirtyPanda,DAE Questions,2,Anxiety,1603469231,"I have a question about a symptom I have been feeling for months and have had a hard time finding anything on it. Does anyone else feel like they are in slow motion? About 9 months ago I had my first panic attack which led to this crippling anxiety that led to me losing 40 pounds in 2 months, no sex drive, spending nights crying in my fiance's arms about how broken I felt. It's been an absolute whirl wind. I went and found help through therapy and I have started to gain my weight back. I feel so much better now but still not exactly like how I was before this all happened. 

But a couple of months ago I got this weird almost dizzy like feeling of everything slowing down and me becoming almost detached from my self. All of a sudden I could hear my own voice, my vision took a couple of seconds to catch up with my head movements, background and foreground blended into one. It was the strangest feeling. It went away after about an hour, came back the next day and then it was gone for a month. Then it came back stronger and more often. I was having these spells every single day and I eventually went to a doctor about it. I was sent to a neurologist and got an MRI of my brain on top of some unique blood tests and everything has come back normal. This is leading me to believe this must be an anxiety symptom. But I haven't seen much about it. Has anyone else experienced this? It's the most frustrating and helpless feeling I have ever dealt with."

Wish I never woke up. I've been having these dreams for years now. Sometimes I'm a man, sometimes I'm a woman, but in them I'm always at complete ease with myself, and I can talk with people just like everyone else can. My favorite was one I had either in high school or college, where I was in this old european town in the seaside, I met this girl and we spent hours just chatting, to this day I have never felt so comfortable as I was in that dream.

In this dream I was participating at some kind of event at college, where a bunch of students shared a house. I immediately became very close to a girl and we became inseparable. I'm 24 and I have no friends since I was 14, so this felt so special to me, to connect with someone like that. We agreed to rent an apartment together after college, things were looking good.

But then I woke up, having to face my reality, where I can't even look other people in the eye without trembling, where I have no friends, no perspective in life. Everyone around me is out there leading their lives and I'm stuck, I haven't studied nor worked in nearly 4 years. I'm about to turn 25 and I have no life experience, I never had my first kiss, never dated anyone, never did anything fun with friends, never traveled anywhere. I know nothing about life.

I don't handle stress well, never have and the last 2 - 3 yrs especially have been stress filled. Even over the holidays. I used to eat because of stress and depression but it seems I've surpassed that now. I'm somewhat okay this week, but I don't know each week if my appetites going to be okay or if a few bites into my meal, I'm going to want to throw up. I crumble when I'm on my own at home and I don't go out alone, period. I used to clean as a way of therapy and now I hate it. It doesn't help and just adds to my stress levels. If I can avoid stress, I will. I'm sleeping on a mattress on the floor because I can't handle the idea of trying to get a bed into my awkward af flat. 

I don't tell any of my family this because my mom is the priority. When I moved out, and in with my SO, to them, I was miraculously cured of all mental ailments. 

She's just.. gone. The only way I can put it is it's like her mind is going 100 miles an hour ever moment of the day that her words, thoughts, tasks and conversations are all getting jumbled together. She still insists on doing 3 things at once though. And she relies solely on myself and my brother for socialising, no one else. And we've both moved hours away from her now. She still didn't try to change her social situation when we told her we were moving. Now she's on her own and in this state. 

But because I'm just slightly closer to her than my brother, he wants me to go. And she wants me to go because (dear god, this is not bragging) I'm her favourite. But I can't do all the things my brother can for her that he wants done for her. And I cannot handle any more stress. Texting her alone right now causes me a great deal that I've just stopped. And I feel fucking guilty for it! I feel guilty for feeling at all the way I feel about her. I don't want to be around her.

On top of it, if I did try to go see her, I'd be risking a massive fine for ""unnecessary travel"". (Covid has left the UK and its government terribly confused and unsure of what to do)"
1064,TheOverthinker3000,Advice Needed,4,Anxiety,1603466392,"Weird anxiety/perfectionism maybe, similar to OCD but not quite..does anyone have this? Hey everyone. This is something I've been dealing with life long and I feel really stupid whenever I talk about or do it. I'm wondering if anyone else has this or something similar, if they found out what disorder it is, and/or if they've lessened or cured it. I've NEVER heard of anyone else having it except my brother. I'm really reaching a point of desperation because it's ruining living with my partner and everyone just thinks I'm trying to annoy them on purpose.

The best way I can describe what happens is my explaining some scenarios:

* If I ask a question and the person doesn't reply, I get extremely anxious and irritated until they reply. The same goes for if I ask a yes/no question and they don't respond with a yes or no. Even someone shaking their head yes/no instead of saying it infuriates me.

* I don't like when someone says ""4 pm"" instead of ""4:00 PM.""

* If someone turns on a light and leaves, me turning it off will cause extreme anxiety and irritation because ""they're the one who turned it on."" It wouldn't matter if I had to leave for work, I'd still want to leave it on until they tell me to turn it off or turn it off themselves. 

There's many others. When I force myself to get rid of 1, another will just replace it. Getting rid of them of course causes extreme anxiety and I lash out at the person. Also, I get anxiety when explaining to someone why I'm doing these things (I can't say it's my ""OCD"" or whatever it's called because that itself is another OCD thing). What a mess.

Sometimes it helps if the person gives my brain a ""code,"" like ""Any time the light is on and I go to work, turn it off."" When my anxiety gets really bad, that will wear off over time, or if they don't say it with the exact words my brain needs, it won't work.

Tell me I'm not alone (although I probably am)."

I'm very proud, we've both been unemployed due to the pandemic and having some money coming in is great. But it's really stressful. I'm managing the apartment, taking care of both of our pets, and running all the household errands. 

This in itself is a lot, but on top of that I started a new job last week (the 12th), so I'm gone for 9-10 hours of the day, leaving just a few to tend to that laundry list of chores, not to mention caring for myself. Working full time has always been stressful for me, it's too much. I get anxious about forgetting something or messing something up, or worse, getting chastised and fired. I hate the song and dance of a new job: introducing yourself 100 times, learning the basics of the office (what's the bathroom code, how do I use the printer, etc) and being taught something once and being expected to know how to do it perfectly. It's all so much. 

I'm so tired. Last night I was asleep by 9pm because I couldn't stay awake any longer. I slept for a full 10 hours and I'm still tired. I'm struggling to eat full meals. It's hard to cook for one, cooking makes dishes, and eating out is expensive and frankly not as safe as I'd like in my area due to COVID. Not to mention that I'm not even hungry because of how anxious I am.

I want to give up. Quit my job, even though there's nothing wrong with it and we need the money. There's nothing I can do about my SO being out of town, but I miss him an awful lot. It's so quiet and lonely in our apartment without him here, and by the time we're both off work we're so exhausted we hardly have a chance to tell each other about our days.

My name is Karol i am amateur musician, for at least 10 years I suffer from anxiety, insomnia and often get sleep paralysis.

Due to pandemic situation across the world and people suffering from sleep related problems, i decided to compose relaxing binaular beats and other relaxing music to help people get through this though times. 

I find out this kind of music does help people, i hope this will also help you to ease your mind. 

If you feel like you would benefit from this kind of music, give a try for my compositions.

All musicial content on my channel is exclusively crafted by myself with feelings that i experienced during that specific time. I will upload new music on regular basis.

TBH this is some kind of self promotion, so if this is not related to this thread please let me know.

Thanks!

I contacted someone that I found on the internet and well, let's say that they were going to come 3 days after I contacted them so they can check and tell me my options to change the window.

For some reason I thought they were thieves and that I was going to get robbed, I tortured myself for three days and on the day that they were going to come I hid everything, from jewelry to my laptop.

I hid my laptop on my pillow case so that it seemed like  there was not even one electronic device in my house.

Context: I don't live in what is considered a red state but I am in a very red leaning county of my state and everyone in the system is commenting on how wonderful it is to have all the students back in school for about 3 months now.

We have class sizes of nearly 20 students with no way to keep them six feet apart, intermingling grade levels, and a school system that says if it's not 15 minutes, we don't have to report it as a close contact.

Many students/staff testing positive is swept under the rug using the 15 minute rule. Teachers are routinely blamed if they test positive for doing something in their personal life when it is most often more likely the exposure came from the school.

This is the environment I am currently on and it's driving me crazy. Everyone is telling me to hold out because everything will go back to normal but our region's cases keep going up.

I can't help but feel responsible as I'm part of this terrible system. I want to quit but everyone keeps reminding me that I'll regret it. I do love being an educator and in a normal year this would be fine but the lack of compassion in the school system is making me nauseous/dizzy/restless(insomnia).

It started as rabies anxiety when a bat came into my room on the 6th september. As far as I'm concerned I was not bitten, and the bat wasn't aggressive towards anyone in the room or the household. This triggered my anxiety and I started to be paranoid that I have rabies. It started on the 13th September when I started having symptoms. These symptoms were occuring regularny, but were slightly less intense at times, but would go away for brief periods of time. At first it was heat flushes and hypertension. I even ended up in hospital for a week, but they laughed rabies off telling me it was very unlikely, and that I would know if I had been bitten. Everyone else that was in the room with me and was exposed to the bat are feeling fine, it's just me who feels terrible which makes me feel that it's because of the anxiety. I was diagnosed with OCD by a psychiatrist yesterday because she viewed my thoughts as obsessive. For some time now I am continuing to experience physical symptoms such as heightened sense of sound, nausea, general fatigue, heat flushes (my face and neck feel warm although I don't have a fever) and my hands and feet are cold. I also continue to have these thoughts despite the logical unlikeliness of contracting the illness in the first place. All these symptoms combined make it hard for me to live my life and I was wondering if I really am sick right now or if it's just the anxiety that's causing these symptoms. Thank you in advance."

I think everyone who lives in the U.S. can agree that the past few months have been filled to brim with anxiety. There has been a pandemic, civil unrest, and mind-boggling politics. I think everyone's general sense of anxiety has increased. However, my anxiety has just sky-rocketed for whatever reason. I've always been a worry-wart. I've always over-thought things, but recently a pit of anxiety has just burrowed into my stomach and it feels like it's here to stay. I always feel stressed, coiled up, and generally unhappy. 

I'm also a college student so that just adds to my stress. Online classes have been ROUGH. I always have something due and I'm always on my computer. I average like 4 hours of Zoom a day. Then, I have to sit in front of my computer for several more hours in order to do homework. I go on walks and they admittedly help, but they're only short reliefs because, before I know it, I'm back doing work in front of my computer. 

I have short bursts of happiness here and there. I know I'm experiencing a happy moment now when I don't notice the anxiousness coiling in my gut. Most of these happy moments occur when I'm in the company of my girlfriend. She's great. I love her dearly. I've tried talking to her about my anxiety and she's been supportive, but I feel like she doesn't know what to say other than ""I'm sorry"" or ""You'll feel better soon."" This is understandable. If our roles were reversed and she had this anxiety building in her, then I would say the same thing. She's my girlfriend, not my therapist. 

I also feel like my anxiety is taking a toll on our relationship because I've been so irritable recently. Little things set me off and, even when I'm in the heat of irritability, I know I'm being unreasonable. I'm always lucid and I know I'm getting worked-up over little things, but I can never stop myself from being worked-up. For instance, my girlfriend and I went to a new taco place the other night for take-out and I got pissed because the tacos, which were super expensive, were also very tiny. I was irritable for the rest of the night.

I don't know what to do. I don't have any money, so I couldn't go see a professional. Any suggestions, Reddit?"

Back story, 
My grandfather passed away in July, and before he died he kept saying, you don't know what ive dealt with. Shes crazy. You will see.....I ended up moving back in with my family because the anxiety was just too hard to handle being alone and dealing with his death as he died on my birthday in front of my eyes.

1) she refuses to shower more than once a week. She tells my mom (her daughter) that ""I don't do anything, I only need to shower one day""
2) she has incontinence issues and smells so much like urine its literally in the air of the house - my mom buys her incontinence pads but we are unsure if she actually changes them daily. (We've been told she reuses them .... my mom has told her to never ever do that)
3) she uses her own cutlery to serve herself from the communal dish. (I get this is something she used to do but jeez my mom has told her so many times, especially during covid) 
4) generally her hygiene is just not good, she will not wash her hands , or will blow her nose than use that tissue to wipe things ""clean""

All in all I'm losing my mind, I cant afford to move out bc they had to up my meds when my grandfather died bc it hit me, but now I'm losing my mind bc I'm scared I'm going to get sick in my own house.... and the smell of urine is actually going to make me vomit. - I have a horrible gag reflex so anything bad smelling make me gag ... please help.

As quarantine's gone on, it's become more difficult to call. I worry how I come across, if I'm going to get yelled at, and what I'm going to say. It's strange to me, because, while I'm no extravert, public speaking comes naturally. It's the one-on-one outgoing call that gets to me, especially now. 

I can only think that it's due to a lack of interaction/activity (now here in the fall) and reactions to a previous job. Before my current position, I used to work overnights in a hotel. I'm a female in my early twenties, and short. I was on-edge a lot of nights, the only person in the hotel. Finding authority was a challenge. I'm no shrinking violet, but it can be difficult when all people see is a small woman (""kid""). So, I'd get yelled and laughed at by old drunks.

Violent intrusive thoughts (mainly knives) to the point where I feel uncomfortable when they are left out, fatigued, loss of interest in sex, etc.

The only symptom I'm missing...is feeling stressed or anxious. 

I have undergone a pretty big life change in the last few months (a big move across the country with my partner) but everything went smoothly and we've settled in just fine to our new place and routines - so I don't feel (consciously) stressed or anxious about that.

These symptoms are really starting to get me down and I feel quite nervous about what is happening in my brain when in all other aspects of life I feel fine.

Does anyone have any experience with this, or advice as to what I could do?"
1118,Melkor462,Advice Needed,2,Anxiety,1601931875,"SSI for Anxiety and Panic Disorder? I was wondering if anyone has been able to get supplemental security income for having anxiety and panic disorder?

I've had a panic disorder for the last 15 years. I've been seeing a psychologist for counseling and psychiatrist for medication for just as long. I was never able to graduate high-school, as attending classes and being around people would give me severe anxiety and panic attacks.

I educated myself from home and studied programming and digital marketing, and have been able to work from home as a freelancer and independent contractor for the past 10 years. 

This past March, as Coronavirus shut down the nation, the companies I contracted for all shut down. While their regular employees worked from home, the marketing agencies didn't have enough business to support independent contractors. I've spoken to some of my previous employers, and by their projections they may not need independent contractors for a year or more.

After 6 months with no income, I've depleted my savings. I can't sustain like this for much longer, and its just contributing to my anxiety levels.

I can't work regular jobs as my anxiety and panic attacks make it impossible to function. Even being at home, in my comfort zone, I struggle with anxiety. Going out to public places and being around people triggers panic attacks. Doing moderate lifting and cardio also triggers my asthma which gives me panic attacks as well.

When I get anxiety, my chest and throat feels tight, I start hyperventilating, I become light headed and have difficulty focusing. As it progresses into a panic attack my arms and legs become numb and its hard to walk and grip things, I becone very nauseous and get a hyperactive bladder, and I generally feel like I am going to die. The only thing I can really do to help it go away is lay in my bed and focus on my breathing.

I've done everything I can to think of a suitable job where I am able to work without having a panic attack, or find more contracting work where I can work from home, but I've had no luck.

I had applied for SSI but they rejected my application saying I was ""capable of working"". I'm not sure how they think I can perform any job while I'm having a panic attack.

They gave me the option to appeal their decision, though I don't know what I could possibly say to change their mind. I'm hoping to find someone who was successful able to get SSI for a panic disorder.

Thanks."

1124,danifearless, ,1,Anxiety,1601929470,"Be Vulnerable, It Just Might Get You Laid **I grew up in a house where hugging lasted only a second.**

It was a way of saying hello &amp; goodbye; simple social formality out of politeness. Maybe grandma would get a peck on the cheek, under duress from my mom, but that was the extent of physical affection in my family.


There are lots of different types of emotional intimacy, but the least complicated of them comes in the form of embracing someone. Think about it...**A hug can completely transcend language barriers, culture, age.** 

Every culture in the world understands the concept of holding someone you care about, and a **20 second hug releases a spike in oxytocin, showing that the concept is ingrained in our very biology.**

Hugs are powerful.

So next time you‚Äôre finding yourself hugging someone, try this:

* Close your eyes and take a deep breath
* Take inventory of the feelings present in your  body and mind. (comfort, longing, recognition, etc‚Ä¶) 

Once you‚Äôre aware of how **you** feel during the embrace, you can shift a portion of your focus to the other person‚Äôs energy

I‚Äôve found value in applying a **70/30 rule.**

**70% attention in
30% attention out**

Don‚Äôt stop this exercise just because you feel self-conscious.

Work through that feeling.

You wouldn't expect to go into a gym for the first time and bench as much as the guy who‚Äôs been going for six years. Everything gets easier with repetition and over time this shit will become second nature to you.

This same concept applies to any physical interactions you have: from hand holding to home-runs.

Kissing gets shoehorned into just an aspect of foreplay--tragically written off as an end to a means, though nice in itself. In long-term relationships especially, small repeated actions of intimacy can help keep you feeling close to your partner.

**I mean when was the last time you really made-out without hoping it would lead to sex?**

So next time, I want you to focus on the connection you‚Äôre experiencing in the moment. It's time to go back to the basics and re-learn the art of good old-fashioned teasing. (Remember when you were ecstatic just to get to second base?)

**Kiss like when you first met.**

Now how is your partner responding to this?
How does she taste? 
How does she feel?
What sounds does she make while you‚Äôre kissing her?

These are the things I want you to bring your awareness to.

With mindfulness and techniques, that I‚Äôll talk about in another post, one can even reach orgasm without direct stimulation (and there are many, many, different types of orgasms.)

Make an evening out of this activity. Light some candles, turn on some music, &amp; enjoy each other‚Äôs company without expectation. 

Cheers for now, 

**Dani**"

Recently some thing happened to us that scared her a lot and possibly triggered anxiety disorder? im not sure if thats possible, but i feel like it is, her dr asked if there was a trigger. after this event, she now sulks around the house worrying about dying from any number of random issues with her heart/lungs, random muscle pains, and gas pains. a gas pain in her abdomen will set her into a terrible downward spiral where she cant stop thinking of (and bleieving) all the stuff that could be causing this pain.  
I do my best to reassure her but nothing I say has any effect, its in one ear and out the other. im getting frustrated in a couple different ways. i feel powerless to help, literally there is nothing i can do/say to help her. im at the point where i have to start lying to her telling her things i cant verify ""oh its just a muscle pain or gas pain"" i mean, ive probably said this over 100 times this passed week and i obviously have no idea either. The second form of frustration comes from repeating myself a billion times. i work in retail and i have buiilt up this pet peeve of repeating myself, if i have to repeat myself more then 3 times. i just dont. i have literally told people the sentence wasnt important because i dont want to repeat myself again.  
Now the worst struggle im having. she feels like im judging her when these attacks happen, and has expressed concern over if I still love her or not. well i do! i really do! but i with these frustrations i feel like i might be having a hard time showing it. like maybe the expression on my face after repeating myself a lot is giving her that thought. im trying to fix it but i just dont know what to do right now.  
we're both stuck in this viscous circling making eachother feel worse i think, with her having it much harder then me i cant imagine what shes feeling. does anyone have any insight? recommendations? anything??

ps. i should mention a bit about myself. i also have a health issue but mine is more physical. I've had it since i was 3yo. im now 31. in all this time i was told to expect to be in a wheelchair by age 20. I used to be anxious and stressed all the time in highschool. i just kinda realized that worrying doesnt make anything better and ive adapted a more go with the flow attitude towards my life and health. this helps with the anxiety of thinking of my future, but does little to impact my mood in the present. lately because of covid and such ive been really depressed, i put my smile on and think of my best jokes everyday to help her but i think she can see theres problem. i dont want my issues to cause her more anxiety...."

We had a rough start, the first year we couldnt hangout much and it was because her and her parents wanted us to have a chaperone.

I felt a lot of pressure to change for her and because I was infatuated I did a lot of this. 

After a year of this back and forth she decided to formally date me and by then I had checked out a bit. Things didn't change much when we were dating aside from me being more withdrawn, we still didnt see eachother much outside of work. We only dated for 2 months before I broke it off because of a few reasons, I was being toxic, I felt controlled and I realized that I had feelings for my bestfriend so I ended things. 

My brain keeps ruminating, I remember when I went to talk to her about ending things I was considering asking her about taking a break as I felt overwhlemed and unsure but it seemed as though this was a mutual feeling so we came to an end instead. After the breakup I confessed my feelings to my friend and we had a short fling, it felt a bit off at first so I kind of pushed her away and said I wasnt quite ready for that but overtime it felt a bit more normal so it continued, then I crashed again and realized once again I couldnt do it so I cut things off cause I didn't want to play her, and I needed to sort my shit out. I waited a while and worked on myself a bit and realized I wanted my ex back so I reached out, we had a good talk she was angry with the hookup for a while understandably but eventually took me back. Things are good, we see eachother lots and there isnt really any pressure, not negative anyways. It's great. Except I am ruminating over my intentions for the break up still - Did I want to take a break just to see how things would go with my friend? Did I just want to hangout with her again ? (Gf at the time asked me to stop hanging out with her when we dated because we were really close and friend had feelings for me, but was respectful - didnt hit on me etc) or did I flat out leave her for someone else? Idk I know I felt sad and relieved after the break up but I keep thinking im a garbage person for how it went down - like I don't think I wanted a break to keep her as a back up I think I genuinely just wanted to see my friend again but then I confessed my feelings when I realized the breakup was more mutual ? Idk what I was thinking I just know I cant accept that things are good now and that I dont feel like I deserve her. Idk what to do please help me figure out how I can sort this out and put it to rest. I have tried talking to her but Im tired of torturing her with the past. Im just so anxious and I want to let this go and be happy since she is over it and things are good, and we are both 100x better to eachother but this guilt is going to make me end things if I dont sort it out.

I have always ""lurked"" around reddit and rarely post. Definitely not something so personal. I feel the anxious energy just tapping this out shakingly. For a really long time I have fought anxiety exhaustingly. For as long as I can remember I can recall the tremble in my arms, my chest, the weakness in my legs. Overall the hysteria in my head at times. I'll spare the finer points, for fear of over-sharing. Most recently I have found what may be my lowest point. Or maybe my biggest obstacle. Three months or so ago I left a really stable job, that I began to loathe on a particular level. The pandemic hit, and my co-workers and I slogged through day by day. It all became a lot to bear. Too much in fact. I left and reconnected with my father. Who I have been estranged with for... my entire life really. 

I wanted to reach him you know? Tell him what I struggled with. My anxiety, my current bout of depression. Feeling lost. Above all my issues with him, ultimately the impact his absence affected me. He quickly shot me down, and emotionally strong armed me. It hurt, a lot. But I understood he only wished to connect with me to absolve himself on his ""death bed"" it still gets to me honestly. I never really opened up to anyone in my life. For fear of rejection. Or the anxiety in and of itself trying to explain what I feel. Often I just soldiered through it. Kept my head down, dropped out of highschool. Sought out finishing school alone. Got myself a job with the help of incredible counselor. Alas, all of those moments themselves were slowly, but more often cataclysmicly self destructed through my anxiety. The stress. The weight. 

Fast forward to my most recent episode. I guess you could call it that? A job I had set up in late July took ages to come together. Eventually I made it to my first shift in late August. Moving to a completely new place a few cities over. My immediate manager my first day seemed to be a little abrasive to me. Just not a gentle person. But I tried not to put too much thought into it. The day languidly stuttered on. And I survived the shift. The next week was filled with silence. Due to a supplier not being able to ship a certain product. Business stuff much out of my scope of know how or relative interest even. I got a call the next Monday and was told I would not be needed any longer. 

I was distraught, filled with this dread. Like I was smothered by a wet three hundred pound blanket. A new city, bills, rent, unemployment. People everywhere, the great big wide unknown. I just lost the plot. Slowly but surely. I couldn't make it to interviews that I had scheduled. My partner had started a new job and began having to travel. Sometimes a week at a time. And I was stuck in this appartment. Peering outside and being frustrated being unable to leave the house. Every time I made an attempt, the monster in the back of my head would shout. I would freeze up, I would panic. I would collapse under the weight of it all. I finally took the precarious step toward help. For the first time in my life I reached out to a doctor. She was so nice, I didn't know how to handle it. I started on my first medication. Sertraline and it has been a war to try and understand it, to try not to let the anxiety tear me away from help. I finally got to the 3 week marker. And scheduled my follow-up. The finish line! Or so I had really hoped. The next doctor I saw, was just as friendly. Funny too. We talked for forty five minutes. Now maybe she just didn't have a lot going on, just killed time with me. But it was nice to connect. To have warmth, seemingly understanding. 

But in that conversation she told me, she felt my perscription may not be the right fit. We would ween me off of this drug that has been a horror show to get onto. And start another. I was crushed. And I'm left anxious and dreading the navigation of this. I'm sorry for such a long post. I guess I just needed to vent. Let all of the grime out. Thank you if you took the time to read this. It means a lot to me. 

tldr; I have agoraphobia and it hit me like a mac truck. Struggling really hard with what feels like a whole new level of anxiety."

I also worry about basically every possible negative thing that could happen to me. I've got some super mild Form of social anxiety and some other insecuritys. I'm already in therapy and my therapist told me I need to do what I fear. 

So today I forced myself to get into situations that I'd previously would have avoided. A week ago I found a old fuked up skateboard and I have been trying out tricks in my garage since then. (cause nobody could see me in my garage). Not only am I incredibly insecure about skateboarding because of my anxiety I'm also insecure about skateboarding because I just started skating and therefore I really am bad at it. But as I said today I forced myself to do uncomfortable things. Therefore I picked up my board, went to the next big city, got into the most busy place and started to drive around. It was amazing. I never felt that confident with myself. I even crashed once but I got up, grabbed my board and went on skating with no hesitation. It was like suddenly all my anxiety was away even though I still was incredibly nervous. But at least I didn't care about what other people thought.

After that I thought to myself ""why not take it a step further"". I already wanted to buy a new board since mine is super broken and old and therefore decided to go to a nearby skate shop. After awkwardly looking around the shop I managed to speak up to a worker and ask some questions. After that I went to another skate shop and did the same thing again. I even chatted with the employee there. I really thought I changed something to the good today.

But now I'm at home and think about what I've done all day. I can't stop to cringe at myself and think about what other people thought of me. I'm like ""omg I fell down in the middle of the street the people must think I'm stupid"" or ""the employees in the skateshop probably were super annoyed with me knowing nothing about skating"".

I even told my mother that I'd like to buy a new board and go to some skateparks and she said to me that my sister used to skate and that she met some pretty bad people in the skateparks occasionally. And that she also found very bad friends there. This obviously makes me super anxious about the whole skating thing. I mean it's so much fun but because of that I'm not sure if I want to go there anymore.

It's a bit of a story, so I'm sorry if it's too much.

I've suffered with serious panic disorder/anxiety since I was young, my parents think it‚Äôs on the ‚Äúgenetic‚Äù side for me. I had Colic as a baby. I had acid reflux as a toddler. I grew up with stomach pains constantly, puking every morning, randomly passing out, and joint pain. I was that ""sick kid"" all through elementary and middle school. It wasn't until I got to junior high (8/9 grade in my district) that I started having panic attacks full blown. They were awful and constant. There were days I just blacked out in the hallway, days my teachers had to take me to the nurse. I was eventually diagnosed, truly, with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and depression at 14. I got on medication, I was ""good"" for a while.

As far as my parents knew, I was doing completely fine once I started the meds. I had maintained a 4.00 GPA all through school and had taken multiple AP courses as well. I was a good student, as weird as it is to say. I was in every music/arts group, I was a drum major, and I was a captain of the golf team. I was able to funnel myself into every outlet I wanted to. I was this creative person who wrote and sold art in my spare time. My mother championed me once I was diagnosed, so proud of everything I could do while dealing with ""mental health 24/7"". She incorporated everything she learned in her studying on mental health into her teaching (she's an educator). It really made it a difference, I could hear it in the stories she told me about her interactions with students. She emphasized school so heavily growing up, monitoring our grades and emails. She was the only one in her family of first-gen Americans to go to a university. My dad hadn‚Äôt truly gone away either, just doing an online degree in his 40‚Äôs. It was odd, but for whatever reason, I internalized that *so much*. All I wanted to do was make my mother proud. I loved hearing how she helped people with how she felt about me. I loved hearing her brag to my family about me becoming a doctor. I loved my extended family telling me everyone was so proud of me ‚Äúgoing away and doing great things‚Äù. I wanted to keep that feeling she (and everyone else) had about me no matter what it took.

Because of this and not wanting to taint her beautiful image of me, I did everything I could to suppress my feelings. The meds *had* worked, but they stopped after a while. I developed really disordered eating and SH habits. I was small, I was hurting myself in multiple different ways. I never said anything. I tried taking a ton of pills once, but it wasn't a conscious suicide-attempt. I think it was more dissociative than anything. I felt like my mom knew to some degree I was hurting myself, but I never had any event happen where I can say for sure. I eventually ""corrected"" myself as I say with the help of my friends, who had all been through their own mental health struggles in some way.

I suppressed it and ignored it until I went to college. I had gotten the full-ride I competed for, was in the major I wanted, and had lucked out in multiple different ways leading up to my first semester. All that lack of sleep, nights from crying from studying, joint pain from writing, and stress puking was worth it now‚Ä¶ right? School was my focus. It always had been. It was my identity. College was supposed to be what I was made for‚Ä¶ but from there, I crashed. I called my family every day, talking about these great things I was doing in band, and the whole time I was binging and spiraling. I managed to stay afloat by begging professors for second chances and using my disability accommodations I had gotten once I went off to school. By the end of my freshman semester of college, I had been on 3 different anxiety meds and was on 4 total. I was also 35 lbs heavier than my weight when I left HS.

This killed my confidence in my second year. I hated music at this point. My college's marching band was very clique-based. The sections' individual cultures were really intense and mine was none existent. People were mean. I talked to no one for 14 hrs every Saturday and it was much more obvious it was intentional. Now, something I had looked forward to all of HS was a bust and I wanted nothing to do with it. Second semester of sophomore year comes around and COVID has hit. I have to go home. I went from my one-bedroom on-campus apartment with my service dog (gotten summer between freshman and sophomore year) back home to my mom teaching from home, my sister (16F) learning from home, and me as well.

I'm 5 different meds in, on 4 still, and none of them are working. I'm in the worst possible place I could be. All while I was dealing with my anxiety/depression worsening with the pressure of college and hiding it to try to stay afloat, my sister had been dealing with hers in much more obvious, destructive ways. Her issues have been stemming from social issues, having changed schools the year before. She was skipping school, flunking, abusing pot, and verbal abusing my mother to the point of tears. I had heard about it in phone calls from my mom over the years while I was away, but now I was there. I was home with all of this happening, none of it really peaking while I was home from school (ie the primary trigger).

Over the course of my time away, my mom‚Äôs calls become this odd way of me feeling useful to my family even though I was gone. I was wanted. I would coach my mom through all this stuff she was dealing with, with my sister. I was good at reasoning through things and putting it well, for someone who was awful at dealing with their own feelings. My mom felt I was objective and it was helpful to her understanding. She kept calling, I kept answering, and my sister kept acting out. I finally got to see what my mom was talking about.

Something I didn‚Äôt expect (in hindsight, I was dumb) was for my sister‚Äôs rage and anxiety to be channeled towards me. She was aggressive and I felt I was dropped without choice into the middle of this. Every night was my sister, mother, and father shouting about school work, behavior in school, or how her car smells like pot even though they cleaned it out after she got caught by the cops again. Everyday I am getting yelled at by her, threatened, dragged into something, or listening to me being heard about. I was ammunition, a catalyst, and a target all at once. Mainly, it was my sister, but my mom would try dragging me in with the expectation I‚Äôd diffuse the situation but it never worked. All my mother‚Äôs talk of ‚Äúnot relying on me‚Äù hadn‚Äôt really worked. She felt like she wasn‚Äôt really and she wasn‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt think she realized how deeply I felt the times that she did and what she did/said. 

End of sophomore year, my sister gets put into the hospital after my parents' concern peaks. She finally ‚Äúdetoxes‚Äù and has to confront what she‚Äôs using the weed to cope with. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I smoke. Marijuana is great if you‚Äôre controlled with it. My sister was 16, *abusing it*, and using it to avoid actually dealing with her problems to the point it was causing her issues with cops, nearly flunking out, and getting aggressive when my parents would toss her stuff. She was using a dab rig before school in her car, hitting her pen in the bathroom, a joint while driving home, and smoking the day away in the bathroom by the window or in her car. 

My mom had a breakdown. Was she a bad parent? Was this the right thing? Is this what would finally help? At least she had one daughter that was on the ‚Äúgood path‚Äù, right? I comforted my mom. Talked to her about what I had hear of in-patient treatment from my friends, what I had seen during my visits to friends, and telling her what my sister needed to learn. My mom, in true fashion, threw herself into research and was trying her damned hardest to make this work. My mom always wanted things to work for us. She cared and tried. She really did. 

Sophomore to junior year, this past summer, I moved in with my boyfriend to try and take a step away from everything going on with my sister. My shot at ‚Äúprotecting my health‚Äù and getting out of a toxic environment for myself. We did great and I felt better than I had in awhile. The whole time I‚Äôm taking classes because I went on probation for my scholarship because of my grades. I change my career path (not major) from all the doubt. I was super nervous going into this year. I was going to be isolated in my apartment, all my 400+ level classes online, and no groups that are accepting this year. 

\[\[Now I‚Äôm here, in the fall semester of my junior year. School has been trash with teacher tech knowledge/use so I‚Äôve had such a difficult time learning, a hard time with my accommodations being met, and the classes are just whooping my ass. I was organized, I felt better prepared but nothing could stick in my head well enough for exams. A‚Äôs on every assignment, every lab, every participation check, but my exams were pushing just too much for me to understand the content truly. I studied, I didn‚Äôt sleep, I drilled. I wanted so badly to do well‚Ä¶ but I just *didn‚Äôt.*

I failed an exam for the first time. Not just ‚Äúdoing bad‚Äù, but to the point I might as well have skipped it and taken a zero. It sounds miniscule in the scheme of things, just one bad test, but it *broke* me. My grade wouldn‚Äôt recover, I would lose my scholarship, I was done. Everything I had worked for my entire life had snapped because of everything I could knit pick. My anxiety had skyrocketed and I was sobbing. I called my mom and finally unloaded on her for the first time. She had me come home for a while, wanting to see if being around family would help.

It has, to some degree. I‚Äôm trying to be positive right now, but I‚Äôm just burnt out. I don‚Äôt know where to go. My sister is applying to colleges now (17/18F) and there‚Äôs so much arguing in the house from that and hybrid schooling. My boyfriend purposely pushes my nerves to be funny and works full time, so now I get worked up even thinking over going over to just be wound up into a minor anxiety attack for a gag and be by myself from 8 pm - 6 pm. I‚Äôm doing better in school now that I really have a space to focus and that‚Äôs what I associated with my room at home, but deep down, nothing‚Äôs changed and I realized that last night.

I‚Äôm where I was in junior high, before I was even medicated. I cycle from an insomniac to fatigue/perpetual exhaustion, I‚Äôm numb, I‚Äôm puking every morning, I‚Äôm twitching all the time, and just a mess. My dad commented on my bags under my eyes for the first time. I‚Äôve lost 15 lbs from not eating/puking. I‚Äôm just uninterested. It‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôm like that, especially because every other facet of my life is going well by normal standards.

Functionally, socially, school-wise I am starting to do better. I am going out with my friends (socially distant and all that), spending time with my family (we do have good moments), and have been doing better in school this past week than I have in a long time. I‚Äôm on meds, I‚Äôm with a better psychiatrist, my dog‚Äôs training is finishing up. I should be good. I wanted to enjoy my best friend‚Äôs 21st birthday with her family and friends partying, I wanted to enjoy my sister doing well on her SAT, I wanted to be happy that I passed my exam from Thursday. I don‚Äôt want my mom to be disappointed. I don‚Äôt want her to have two broken kids. I want to be better for her. I want to keep my scholarship. I want to have something to look forward to in life. 

I should be calm, satisfied, and happy with the direction of my life right now. I‚Äôm on an upward trend, it‚Äôs a positive. I see that. Why can I just not be happy with it? Instead, I am exhausted, apathetic to everyone/everything, and I‚Äôm just *done*. I just feel burnt out. I just want to hit a reset button on my body and not feel so tired, dull, and tense. Why do I just feel like I want to sleep and not wake up? I‚Äôve powered through before. I should be able to handle this. I want to be able to handle this. I just really, really don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt know how I could put my life on pause though to really do that. I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù for a week, a month, whatever. College doesn‚Äôt stop, my mom and sister‚Äôs lives don‚Äôt stop, life keeps going. I have to catch up or I‚Äôll just slip off. Is this ‚Äúburnt out‚Äù? Is that what this is? Or is this just me not keeping up? Is this me just hitting ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù and not being prepared enough? I‚Äôm only 20 and if this is how hard life is meant to be, I‚Äôm scared. 

I‚Äôve spent the past hour writing this. I know the wording isn‚Äôt the best and the grammar probably isn‚Äôt strong, but I needed to get it off my chest somehow. I know I couldn‚Äôt authentically say it to anyone. That‚Äôd be too hard.\]\]

TL,DR: I‚Äôve grown up with anxiety my entire life. My mother and I have made my entire identity around school. My sister has started dealing with social issues and severe anxiety/depression. My mother views me as a success story and I internalize that pressure. I‚Äôm struggling in school and my mental health has plummeted, but my mother is focused on my sister and I don‚Äôt want to break my mother‚Äôs expectations of me. Am I burnt out or am I just behind the ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù?"

\---

Hi everyone - I'm a long-time anxiety sufferer, but have been managing pretty well with a combination of meds and therapy. That is, until something happens that manages to knock me too far off balance. 

Long story short, I have a bit of an ant problem. I got back from a visit to a friend, and bam, ants in my apartment.  Obviously a bit of a stressor for anyone, but even after putting down my own bait traps (somewhat effective, but still had ants) and calling a pest control company (they put down more bait, jury's still out on how effective it is), I still find a few of them crawling around my kitchen floor every day. 

I think this wouldn't be an issue if they weren't in the kitchen, but I'm reaching the point where I can't seem to function normally anymore. I wake up super tense and anxious. I go to bed tense and anxious. I haven't been eating well because I'm afraid to cook or eat food in the vicinity of the ants. My body is pretty angry at me. I have at least one breakdown to a friend or family member a day. Sometimes I can't do anything but cry.

I feel ridiculous. The ants are small. I *know* they can't hurt me. I *know* this may be something I have to live with for a bit while the professionals figure out where they're coming from and how to get to the source of the problem. But try telling that to the anxiety elephant sitting on my chest. 

I've experienced a similar pattern of events before with different issues. Something happens that's out of my control and that I can't escape from. I get into a pattern of really bad anxiety in the morning and at night, with some reprieve during the day while I'm at work or talking to people I trust. I start to avoid activities that bring me into contact with the trigger that I can't control. Weekends are generally terrible. 

If anyone else has had similar experiences and/or found a coping mechanism that helps manage the intense waves of anxiety, I'd appreciate hearing from you. Mostly, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel really alone (it doesn't help that I live alone) and I'm scared. Thanks."

Today was the first day we had to go in lectures since the break up and as soon as i woke up i was shaking. 

The nearer i was getting to the university the worst it was becoming. 
When i entered the building and started going up the stairs i felt dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous and my muscles started hurting. 
When i was already on the 4th floor where my first lecture was, i had shortness of breath, my mouth was super dry, and almost fainted + the symptoms from before (i am atletic and healthy) . It was severe for around 15minutes and then it calmed down. But i felt the symptoms, untill we finished lectures. 

When i went home i cried for a little and then went to the toiled and had diarrhea(i haven't eaten anything since she broke up with me, thats 4 days now).

 At the moment of writing this i still shake a little and dont feel good at all. I am not hungry either (which is weird for me as i am 87kg and 190cm tall and get hungry as soon as i wake up or after lectures usually)

So I apologize in advance if this is insensitive of me, but I just want to understand better about why I'm behaving this way. 
Before 2020, I used to be quite an amicable and sociable person. I've always felt anxious before meeting someone new or having to hang out with someone I'm not very close to, one-on-one, but it was something that I could handle. However, during this pandemic, we all quarantined for months and now that things are easing up in my country and we are allowed to travel and meet our friends a bit more freely, I feel very very anxious. I feel like I've forgotten how to socialise with people, I'm not quite sure what to talk about. My mind is just always blank and feel nauseous hours before I have to meet someone. I just started an internship recently and I've been absolutely DREADFUL at making conversation with my colleagues. Usually, I'd be awkward for the first one week but I'd be able to ease into a new setting and converse with people. But this time round, I've been in the company for around a month and I can't seem to converse with anyone. And don't get me wrong, the people who I'm working with are absolutely lovely, they initiate conversations also. But I seem to have forgotten how to converse in full sentences, how to continue a healthy conversation. And it really SUCKS. THIS FEELING. And the painfully awkward moments that everyone around me has to endure. What can I do to cope with this better? Anyone has any tips? Or maybe does anyone else feel this way?"

A random worrisome thought pops into my head followed by a sensation of panic, I start breathing heavily and feel almost a sort of distress in my belly that makes me want to wrap my arms around it.

But it only lasts for a very short amount of time, like 5 seconds or so. However, it happens very often, like maybe around 7 times daily.

It's almost as if my sensations of panic come in smaller doses throughout the day instead of all at once.

I've had other types of problems with anxiety and depression before, but not with this specific form and I thought panic attacks used to last much longer. Is this tied to the anxiety or can it be some other type of mental problem?"

So I have a best friend and we have been friends for more than 8 years. We are both guys and he is like a brother to me. I'm having trouble as the anxiety is controlling me more than it should. As he dates around looking for relationships, I feel abandoned and fear that once he finds a girlfriend that he won't spend anytime with me or want to hang out although he is not looking for any girl right now.. I am single as well, because I haven't felt comfortable with any girl as much as with him in terms of feeling comfort.

But yet, he betrayed me a couple of times back in the days. I've had the worst summer since my group of friends (including him) abandoded me for the whole summer. In times like this I am getting ""over"" him by persuading myself that he is not my real friend and he does not deserve my affection, but on the other hand, we have spend a week together with our other friends and I have absolutely enjoyed his company. He was making me feel validated and secure, but it's not always like this. 

I am really anxious that he will betray me again in the future, but I just can't help myself stressing over the fact that once we won't be as close as we are now. I know it sound stupu and even like I am gay, but I am 100% straight and I just can't understand how can I be so attached to a guy.

1222,beardosaurusrex,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1609804528,"Ideas on Creating a ""Neutral Space""? I'm looking for advice on how to negotiate a situation with a friend--we both have pretty bad anxiety, especially social anxiety.

My two best friends, Alice and Vanessa, and I started a tradition a couple of years ago of going on a weekend trip together shortly after the holidays. The last two years, it was a Christmas gift from Alice to me and Vanessa, but this year we decided to plan it together and share the costs. 

In years past, we've gotten an Airbnb out of town and spent 3 days/2 nights. Normally that plan would be fine, but even aside from the obvious Covid concerns, the timing isn't great for me financially. My husband and I have been incredibly lucky to have kept our (relatively well-paying) jobs during the pandemic, and we've just started moving forward on getting pre-approved for a mortgage loan to buy our first house. This trip is important to me and I want to make it work, but I also want to keep the costs down as much as possible given that we want as much saved as possible for a downpayment. 

As a potential solution, I suggested we spend the weekend on my parents' boat, instead (it has enough beds, an oven/stove, sink, microwave, bathroom, etc.). It's also moored in a marina, so power and internet are available, we could order takeout, go for walks, etc. 

When I brought up the idea to the group, Vanessa said that she feels uncomfortable with it, since she often feels like an outsider in spaces that aren't hers, and having a place that none of us has been before is helpful to her. I've definitely had that feeling before and I don't want to be dismissive of it, but I think my concerns are just as valid. I want to try to come up with a solution that is sensitive to her comfort *and* my financial concerns (not to mention that with the pandemic, I'm just a lot more comfortable knowing that only my dad will have been there for weeks, if not months, both before and after our visit).

Alice also expressed some financial concerns to me privately but seems fine moving forward with either the boat or an Airbnb (and also has anxiety, so she probably doesn't want to feel like the ""tiebreaker"").

So the crux of my question is this: does anyone have advice on anything she or I could do to help mitigate the outsider feeling? Anything I can do to make her feel more welcome/empowered in the space, or anything I can recommend she try before/during?"

1224,Supahotfayya,Family/Relationship,0,Anxiety,1609804142,"Things should be getting better, but by anxiety is getting worse than ever For the first time in my life, i‚Äôve finally found a girl who i feel like i can really be myself with. Previously in my life, the only way i would get the confidence to approach girls in a ¬´romantic¬ª context was through getting drunk. 

At 21 years old, my anxiety and depression made me think i‚Äôd never be capable finding anyone who could love me. I finally thought ¬´fuck it, i‚Äôve got nothing to lose now¬ª, and created a tinder account. A few months later after just talking to matches without actually meeting them, i was drinking with a couple of friends and decided to meet up with a girl i‚Äôd been chatting to. 

Surprisingly, we clicked really well and went back to my place and slept together (my first time sleeping with anyone in about 2 years). After that we began seeing each other a few times a week (mostly sleeping with each other, but we also talked a lot and ate breakfast etc. too). The first few times i had to drink before i saw her to gain confidence, but i decreased my intake over time until i felt confident meeting her without drinking. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic at all btw, and i drink very rarely in general. 

From time to time i got anxiety attacks, and i‚Äôve started throwing up in the bathroom 3-4 times while i‚Äôve been with her, saying i get nauseous quite a lot. I‚Äôve had anxiety for a long time, but after being with her, i‚Äôve started throwing up, even though i feel completely fine most of the time i‚Äôm with her. I think it is because it is the first time in my life where i‚Äôm in love with someone who really seems to like me back, and the fear of that ending makes me really anxious. 

After seeing her for about 2-3 months, she left back home for christmas, and i haven‚Äôt seen her almost a month. She is coming back to the city next week because school is starting again. These past couple of weeks my anxiety and depression has been worse than ever. I haven‚Äôt been able to eat enough food and have been starving, and when i do try i to eat i get nauseous and sometimes i throw up. It takes me hours to sleep and i am almost constantly anxious. I‚Äôve always been anxious, but now i‚Äôve had daily anxiety attacks for about a week, and i can‚Äôt relax for a second. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure the reason it‚Äôs gotten worse is that i now have something to lose, and i really don‚Äôt want to lose her. This girl is way out of my league - she has loads of friends, is in great shape etc, while i have nothing in comparison. She has no clue about how shitty my life actually is, and i feel kinda guilty about wasting her time cause i don‚Äôt think she would want to be with me if she knew how mentally fragile i am. I‚Äôm really looking forward to her coming back, but i also have no clue about what to do, if i should open up about my problems or just pretend that i‚Äôm fine while going through the worst time of my life.

It‚Äôs so fucked up that now i‚Äôve finally started experiencing my deepest desire in life, to find someone to love, and in some ways been happier than i‚Äôve been in years, i‚Äôm also going through the worst period of my life due to the stress around it.

I‚Äôll keep is short. When I was a young child I was burned with an iron, cigarette,scarred, and a few years later assaulted to where I had 6 of my fingers broken at the joints. I suffered from terrible health. I was stalked and harassed. It all accumulated a few months ago where I felt I was everything that was wrong with me. I was scared of anything. If I got a spam phone call the first thought to my head was ‚Äúsomeone is going to hurt me‚Äù. Going to the store was a challenge because I was scared someone would hurt me. I was scared to go out in public because someone may hurt me. It‚Äôs like being on edge 24/7 and even suffered vivid dreams and nightmares.

Going to therapy I learned that I have anxiety. My mind blocked most of the trauma away. It feels like it happened to someone else but when I look at my skin I see the burn scar. My therapist assured me I‚Äôm not crazy but asked me to find where that voice comes from. In the process is like my anxiety is a younger version of myself scared someone is going to hurt me. That part of me is so full of love and happy go lucky most of the time, but when I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs like another part of me kicks in depending on the situation. In this process I found like 4 strong facets of my personality and I feel like they‚Äôre combining to make a more whole version.

I am coming here for support, but also I‚Äôm confused. I thought going to therapy would ‚Äúfix‚Äù me but I feel like I‚Äôm even more confused. My therapist assured me self-talk is common and we have different personalities based on the situation, but it is all me. Has anyone else ever encountered this situation?

I didn't feel scared at first, but the experience of losing my grip on ""reality"" and being unable to focus properly made very anxious and paranoid, though I don't think responded physically in any way.

I got a temporary job working from home and started to take a little bit better care of myself. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a overnight switch but a slow and unsteady progress. I'm happy to say I made it to my temporary job's end date without quitting early (which is an accomplishment to me). I'm excited to take a little break before jumping into another part time job that I lined up. The anxious thoughts are still there but the distress they used to cause me is much less. Peace to you others out there.

I'm someone who is a completely different person depending on where you catch me and the company that I'm with at the time. I rely on entering physical spaces to cue myself to ""be the correct me"". When I was a kid, I'd hate whenever my friends would meet my family because those are two different worlds that aren't meant to interact with each other. I'm feeling the same exact way right now about working from home.

I know it's almost been a year, but idk maybe it's been a while coming and now my tolerance for it has just reached the lowest point.

When I'm trying to get work done, all I can think of is what needs to be done around the house, or I feel like I'm slacking by not cleaning or cooking or doing some chore or something. When I do try to wash the dishes, cook or clean, all I can think of is all the work I could be doing that isn't getting done. Either way, no matter what it is I choose to focus on, I feel completely useless and like I'm wasting time. I hate sounding dramatic, but the best way I can describe it is that I feel like worlds are colliding and the collision is turning my brain into mush. Like my thoughts can never be fully formed before being torn down by another thought trying to form. I'm constantly grasping at the smallest straws to feel the slightest form of productivity or gratitude.

I feel incoherent, useless and like I'm letting down everyone involved--co-workers, clients, my wife. I feel like if I ever tried to put my thoughts into words, I'd be deemed melodramatic and like I'm overreacting. I don't necessarily know what I want out of this post or community--I guess I just needed a void to throw this out to, and this was the void I chose. But I guess if anyone else felt this way, how did you deal with it?"

1252,MrRiddle18,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1609798005,"I'm struggling getting close to people. I know this problem is not uncommon, especially probably in this subreddit, but here goes. 

I was with someone for 10 years, the last 3 I was kept a secret from every single person in their lives. I never felt good enough to be a significant person in their life again after our initial break up on the 7 year mark. Our relationship was toxic but I loved her and I wanted to make it work. Towards the end of the final year she had a surprise visit from a family friend and she shut me in a room and told me not to make a sound till they left. I left her initially because neither of us were happy, no one cheated. Nothing bad really happened I just wanted to find my happiness in other areas of my life and bring that back into the relationship.

Anyways, after I was shut in a room I realized I was never going to be good enough to be in her life, so I established friend boundaries and things have been okay there since. I'm struggling though, with other relationships in my life. I'm afraid of being close to someone because I feel like I'll never be good enough for someone to bring into their lives again. 

I don't talk very much to anyone because I'm afraid that if people get to know me they won't like me and they'll just phase out. Last night I broke that and started getting intimate with someone over text and I panicked and blocked them after.  (I know. Asshole move, but this wasn't like something major. I'd only known them for about 12 hours.) I feel guilty for doing that to someone and its my fault for letting it get to that point. I just... want to feel good enough, but I'm terrified of being in another situation like my past relationship. 

For the record, I am happy alone, I'm even okay with being alone. I just, want more out of life than working and then going home alone to play video games. I want love in my life and I want to work with someone on building a future together. I just don't know how to let go of my anxiety after spending so long being hurt by someone in the most significant relationship of my life. How am I ever going to meet someone and build trust and feel safe? I feel okay when I'm alone but when it comes to other people I feel like a complete mess."

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know why, but every time I eat, think about eating, or get too full especially I get massive anxiety. I have been underweight my entire life but really haven't cared too much nor have ever felt a sense of body dysmorphia. For the past two years though I have wanted to get into the healthier ranges of the BMI just for personal physique and so I'm just not skin and bones.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that whenever I eat food, I get no euphoria or pleasure except from just the taste itself, and when I eat maybe a bit too much everything spirals. Firstly I almost never have the urge to eat which is an issue. And then furthermore when I do eat I feel absolutely sick and get extreme anxiety like I'm going to die. None of this helps with my goals and aspirations and I haven't found anything to help my scenario. It seems to be uncommon and no one knows what to do... I feel like I'm alone. I've ate before and felt amazing, it was weird just like a regular day I made a regular meal and felt really good but yet that almost made me mad in a way. It was like I understood why people like food so much, but that was one day out of years to me not feeling that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem is just eating food to get full is hard in itself because after a few bites it's like the food get's bland and monotonous and after like 10 or so I am almost repulsed by it... its why I think it's a mental thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to harbor feelings that eating is good when I just get beyond nauseous even thinking about eating and then just getting nauseous after I eat. I get a fight or flight response effectively and I do not know what to do about it. I'm really writing this hoping someone else shares this problem with me, and if there's anything that helped when trying to overcome it. It's hard for me because I get the same result every time and I just want to feel good after I eat or at a minimum not get extremely paranoid about it...

&amp;#x200B;

For the record my weight is 128 and I'm a 5'10'' male... I hit 135 after going extreme mode and just forcing myself day in day out to gain weight but it just wasn't maintainable. I don't know what to do. In a way I think my stomach controls most if not all of my emotions for some reason which is garbage because its almost always queasy. Diet changes have also not worked for me, I don't know what else I can do."

1270,Hagraw,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1609794043,"Severe anxiety over my hobby. Don‚Äôt want it to be this way. So, a little bit of context first of all. One of my main hobbies has always been fixing things. Since I was a kid I was always taking things to pieces and trying to fix them instead of throwing them away. Often I would fail, but as I‚Äôve gotten older and gained more experience and equipment, I‚Äôve been more successful.

About 4-5 years ago I began to get into fixing my own cars and family/friends‚Äô cars. I rarely visit a mechanic for my own cars, and have done the majority of jobs myself. I am entirely self-taught. When thinking rationally, I realise that nearly all of the jobs have been successful, and if I‚Äôve made any mistakes I learn from them and never make the same mistake again.

However, every job, big or small, gives me severe anxiety symptoms:

If jacking up the car, I have experienced full-blown panic attacks, nausea, dizziness, and hallucinations of the car falling, so I attempt to escape 

I am constantly in a state of assuming the worst and will avoid performing certain jobs as far as possible as I presume they will lead to failure, until physically forced to. These are often the most trivial things, such as bleeding cooling systems (risk of overheating due to airlock etc), or generally looking under the bonnet while the car is running, which I hate doing because I feel like something is more likely to break/snap/explode while I‚Äôm looking at it. Lo and behold, every time, everything goes perfectly.

I over-research jobs and procrastinate to try and control every single variable that could possibly be encountered, to the point where it gets so late in the day that I run out of time to start, which leads to more anxiety, which leads to more reluctance to starting etc etc.

This has recently come to a head. I have recently bought my girlfriend a car - it‚Äôs a nice car for its age, but needs a few things doing to it; small jobs such as a minor ABS issue, a timing belt that is a little overdue and needs replacement, and a thermostat stuck open. However, every time I think about fixing these, I overprepare, experience severe anxiety (eg nausea, shaking, loss of sleep, fast heart rate), despite having tackled all 3 of these multiple times on other cars. Therefore I introduce more anxiety over the promises I‚Äôve made to others.

Once I fix something, the sense of achievement feels incredible and I do not wish to give up this hobby as this would mean the anxiety has won. But, the worsening anxiety is beginning to sap all enjoyment out of it as it takes me forever to get anything done, and affects my confidence and self esteem. Does anyone have any tips to help manage these symptoms? 

TL;DR - anxiety over my hobby of fixing cars for myself and family/friends. Getting worse but don‚Äôt wish to stop doing my hobby because of this. Any advice?"
1271,terrastoneborn,Trigger Warning,0,Anxiety,1609793970,"Can somebody explain what's going on with the Pfizer vaccine in the UK? TW - COVID-19 &amp; the vaccine.

Okay so I have health anxiety and thanatophobia. As I'm sure you can imagine, ""hell"" is not a strong enough word to describe the past year.

Can somebody explain to me what's going on with the vaccine in the UK? I was so happy when it was approved. An end to this constant hell was in sight. But now the government are apparently administering the second dose after 12 weeks rather then 3, and Pfizer have said that they don't know if that will work because it's not how it's been tested. They don't know if the first does will be effective after 21 days without the second. But the government are going against that anyway.

Is there something I don't know about this? Now I'm scared that this will never end because the vaccine isn't going to work because the government are more concerned about getting the number of people who've had the first dose really high to make themselves look good than actually vaccinating people properly. Please tell me there's some science I'm not understanding here.

I just want to be able to go outside again without extreme anxiety.

In case it wasn't clear, this is not an anti-vax post. Vaccines work and they are safe. This is a post about the government seemingly not administering the vaccine in the way it's supposed to be administered.

I usually only struggle with the physical symptoms, which for me made it incredibly difficult to overcome because I had no idea where it was coming from or how to prevent it. 

My therapist recommended a book to me and I can honestly say it has made a HUGE impact on my anxiety. I still feel it, but I‚Äôm coping so much better and I haven‚Äôt needed my medication at all since I started using what I‚Äôve learned. 

The book is called The Anxiety and Worry Workbook by Clark and Beck. It‚Äôs a radical acceptance approach to anxiety and that was really difficult and intimidating to me at first, so much that my initial reaction was frustration, and to throw the book out, but once I realized that my patterns of thought hadn‚Äôt gotten me very far and I needed to be open to a different perspective, I‚Äôve made so much progress. 

I really really recommend this book to anybody dealing with anxiety in any form. It‚Äôs very detailed and helps you gain a better understanding of exactly what thought patterns are causing you distress, and a step by step of how to adjust that. I thought this wouldn‚Äôt apply to me because like I said, usually for me it‚Äôs just physical symptoms that then spiral into mental, but it has made me accept and cope with sensations.

1274,PaulFThumpkins,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1609793311,"Is this panic disorder or something else? A couple nights ago I had one of those nights where I kind of felt wired while trying to sleep, and midnight turned into 1, turned into 2, turned into 3...

Suddenly something I can't describe hit, and I had to throw myself urgently out of bed and pace the house, just cursing urgently under my breath. But there was no heart racing, no sweating or anything like that, just a feeling of sudden, intense surreal depression and bleakness. No fear of death or a heart attack, just existential despair. Trying to lie back down in bed just brought that feeling back, but I managed to curl up on the carpet and fall asleep that way. It never really ""faded"" and the dreams were very stressful and surreal.

Since then I've felt about half that bad. Trying to sleep (got about 15 hours the night before last, maybe sleeping about half that time) makes me feel nervous and deeply depressed as soon as I start to relax, and the whole day I feel exhaustion and distress alternating seemingly second by second. Every motion, talking or thinking hurts and it's all I can do to just take the dog out or eat. I'm trying to fake it through my workday so I can lie down, take a sleep aid and just try to shut my brain off for a couple of those hours. I've been meditating for a few months and within minutes of starting the dread sets in again.

I think I'll be all right, but this happened to me a few years ago and it persisted for a couple of months (and maybe a year past that in less intense form) and kind of ruined my life. I have anxiety and general anhedonia (not quite depression) but this is a different thing entirely.

So I have recently had a loved one go through a hospitalization and subsequent institutionalization for their mental health concerns. It has been a VERY long and hard and confusing and frustrating process. This led me to thinking... man, there really are a lot of gaps in the mental health industry. This is a very hard and confusing industry to navigate. So I had a business idea... the basis is that I am a helping hand with LOTS of experience in the realm of mental health, and I will help people through all aspects of their mental health journey. This includes assembling a mental health team, helping with diagnoses and accommodations, help locating and selecting inpatient facilities, and even help through a crisis.

Every few months I try to think about areas in my life I can improve (80% revolve around improving my financial situation), and I usually land on getting a better job or starting a side hustle. I end up sidelining all my other hobbies to focus on that one thing, but for the next following weeks I get analysis paralysis, thinkings things like ""Is this the right thing to do? Is it a waste of time? Should I keep my job?"" and I ultimately end up giving it up and wasting a ton of time. 

It's become a cycle, every 2-3 months. I think about how mediocre my situation is, try to improve it, overthink it, get nothing accomplished, then back to my routine. 

Last night I thought long about how to structure my days since coming off Christmas and thought about taking up the hobby of writing (an area I would like to improve at), but today I've been overthinking if writing is a good hobby to take up? If there's something I'd like to do more, that would help my career? Or a hobby I can look to monetize? I keep becoming more unsure of my own decisions and intentions. 

Eventually, I want to land a better job and try to find something that helps my financials out, but this constant cycle of overthinking and analysis paralysis and ultimately quitting on what I'm working on is so tiring. At this point, it's becoming depressing and each time it happens I become more unsure of myself and more anxious."

But I feel like I'm reverting in this particular situation. I was interviewed by 3 people and I know it's not very many but I can barely handle 1 person... being watched and feeling like you're being scrutinized by 3 people is apparently too much for me to handle. Then comes the test. 1 person laid out the problem he wanted me to solve. I saw the question and I thought ""oh, I've done this before I can do it"". But no. Oh my god, I don't know what happened, I swear my brain just shuts down. I keep trying to see how I'd solve the problem but all I did was writing the same thing over and over again, thought I got somewhere, then it's all clouded shit and I kept doing that multiple times without progress. I can't think of anything but how long I'm taking just to solve some basic shit but the thought made me even more stressed and return to step 1.

It also doesn't help that the interviewer keeps trying to talk to me (not their fault, they did their best to make the situation less stressful, but I'm the one that keeps feeling more pressured). After it's over I feel so... dumb, frankly. The interviewer was nice, but I'm the one that looks stupid. I thought to myself, maybe I'm just stupid?

""What does this thought I just had say about me, is it my subconscious speaking to me?"" ""Am I a bad person, a good person, is there such thing as either?"". The only peace I get is when reading science articles. Pure objective science articles, in a world filled with people who pretend to know everything I'm filled with peace when I realize just how much I don't know. I'm just a bot stuck in a recursion loop. 

What do I do to break this cycle and silence my head? I've tried meditation but my brain screams louder in silence. Is this just something that is normal for everyone? I bite my nails, scribble in journals at 2 am, twist and rip my hair out. I went to a psychiatrist once and you know what they told me? ""Did you ever try to NOT rip your hair out?"" Oh jeez Sherlock thanks you've cured me. My family thinks I'm crazy for ripping my hair it, I do it without thinking which is why I always shave my head or wear a hat. Never going to another shrink again. When I was younger (9-17) I'd have very very vivid day dreams of me dying, I just hated myself so much

I met a girl once and she was the same exact way, the difference was I was so good at hiding my anxiety that she thought I was her ""rock"" when in fact I was constantly losing it and internalizing it. It was the same anxiety that ruined our friendship, sucks because I actually cared about her. 

I know my sister has some level of anxiety but I don't think she has it like me. Whenever I day dream my brain will purposely do something I don't want it to do simply because I don't want it to do that. I'm constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts that I try to let them pass by because they're just thoughts and can't hurt me but they're sometimes very disturbing. 

Worst part is at the beginning of each morning I wake up and go ""damn I was wildin last night, what was I so anxious about?"" But the anxiety is still there hidden beneath layers."

Some benefits I found after doing this method for 2 weeks:
- a lot less stress and anxiety, especially after I did the breathing exercise and the cold shower.
- A LOT more energy throughout the day.
- Less annoying thoughts that cropped up that distracted me / made me feel anxious.
- A huge mood improvement.

It wasn't really harsh though, it was just pointing out that I couldve expanded on the sentence LOL I didnt continue and havent read the rest of the comments oof

I also have a tendency to close my eyes and slowly peek at the grade so I dont get caught off guard. As someone who aspires to have a design-related career, I want to be able to get back into being less affected by critiques or feedback. It's really annoying and the chest pain yesterday really made me think about this problem seriously.

 The way i react is the same as when I try to not look at space and planet images online or google earth (ya i have that phobia lol). So I dont want it to develop into a fear.

my mom has been feeling something similar to what i describe and she keeps on hitting her muscles with her fist bc of the discomfort as well. but im really not sure if we feel the same. their office nurse speculated that she may have anxiety and she might have to consider getting psychological help.

For the last 2 years, it‚Äôs been really bad again. It‚Äôs worse now than I think it‚Äôs ever been. I have no confidence in my ability, I feel totally incompetent and I‚Äôm easily stressed out.

I also took a leave of absence for a few weeks in early summer. 

I dread going to work everyday. I often cry before and during work. I use junk food and cigarettes to incentivize myself to get through the day. I get snippy with my coworkers. I often think about suicide and I‚Äôm constantly fighting the urge to self harm and/or drink to calm my nerves. 

My job is very stressful, even for those without anxiety. I‚Äôve thought about looking for a new job but I‚Äôd have to pay back part of a sign on bonus and I‚Äôm worried because my resume is already full of short term jobs. I worry about my ability to find something else.

My biggest issues are school anxiety, grief, a family member in the home with severe mental illness.

She said some stuff that deeply hurt me and told someone things I had told her in confidence.

I said I needed a break to think things through. She didn‚Äôt understand and wanted to talk about it. We FaceTimed and it didn‚Äôt go well. After that we didn‚Äôt talk much for a long time. At one point we tried to text about it but it didn‚Äôt make me feel better, if made me feel worse. My whole relationship with her was causing me anxiety and it was a lot of drama trying to compete with my sister for her friendship and always losing because I‚Äôm not the insecure one that needs to be reassured that she‚Äôs friends with me. I finally told her (over text I know you‚Äôre not supposed to do it that way but at this point that‚Äôs the only way we ever communicate anymore) that I couldn‚Äôt be close friends with her anymore because it wasn‚Äôt healthy for me anymore and she really hurt me and on top of that she‚Äôs younger than me and we‚Äôre really on different levels of maturity right now and different stages of our lives. The problem with me ending things with her is that she‚Äôs also been adopted and her whole life she said no one wanted her for years and she‚Äôs been abandoned by so many people that told her they would be there for her. I told her I would be there for her and she could count on me and I wouldn‚Äôt leave her like everyone else. She told her entire life story to me and she said I‚Äôm the only person she‚Äôs ever trusted to tell. Now after I broke things off with her she sent a mixed message thanking me for being her friend and also telling me that she learned from me that the people you trust and love the most will break you in the end and that I taught her that and that because of me she will never be close to anyone ever again and I reminded her that she shouldn‚Äôt trust anyone because they‚Äôll just leave her and I did leave her after saying we would be friends for forever but I couldn‚Äôt stay in that unhealthy relationship anymore because it wasn‚Äôt good for me and sometimes people grow apart but she didn‚Äôt take it that way. She blamed me for everything. I guess I just want at least one person to tell me that I‚Äôm not crazy and that I wasn‚Äôt obligated to be her friend after she betrayed my trust and hurt me and that it isn‚Äôt my responsibility to fix her trust issues from her past and that I‚Äôm not to blame for how the friendship ending made her feel due to her past abandonment issues.

My dog found a raccoon this evening right at dusk. She was playing behind our house in my line of site when my 12 year old neighbor said ""Is that a cat? I think that's a wild animal!"" I thought she was over-reacting, and I actually didn't see the animal right away. But my dog had it's ears and tail perked and was about to go investigate something. I think I even saw her bend her head over to sniff something, but I'm not sure.

What I am sure of, is there was no attack, no fight, no scuffle, no quick jerk away from a painful swipe or bite, no yelp or squeel from my dog. Nothing. I simply called her over out of an over abundance of caution (I was honestly more worried about her chasing a cat into the woods and losing her) and she happily trotted over. I put her in the house and went to go investigate the spot I think she had been about to sniff. Shined my flashlight on the area and saw a raccoon chillin'. I don't know if it was sick or hurt, but it didn't seem terribly afraid of me.

I hightailed it inside and immediately called our vet. It's after hours, so I spoke with a tech. My dog is up to date on her vaccines, so the tech said if we didn't see any wounds, she's probably fine... And that set me off. The probably... Proooooooobably fine. So my fucking crazy ass called a 24-hour vet for a back up opinion. Same response, if she'd been bit there would be a mandatory quarantine, but because she's up to date on her shots and we didn't see any wounds... She's *probably* fine. BUT TWO OPINIONS WASNT ENOUGH!! I fucking called a third clinic!!!! A third, random clinic in my area who told me the SAME FUCKING THING! No wounds? PrObaBlY DoN't NeEd ToO WoRrY!

And trust me, my crazy fucking brain wants to find them) Guess who's already made a plan to call her actual vet tomorrow morning and not just the vet tech for a FOURTH opinion? Guess who's been told by her husband to calm the fuck down because she's having an insane panic attack? (Not his actual words. He's very sweet) Guess who is convinced that her dog somehow licked the raccoon and contracted rabies? Guess who is convinced there is a hidden microscopic bite or wound somewhere on my dog that the raccoon breathed on wrong? Guess who is making plans for the eventuality that my sweet little love muffin of a dog will suddenly snap and become a Cujo-esque monster? Guess who has accepted the fact that she's going to need to euthanize her 2 year old dog?

So my father has always been quite overprotective of me (M, 24) for as long as I have known him and we have always dismissed it as being part of his personality/nature. But since the advent of the coronavirus, his habits and worries have become amplified. I only recently read up about Generalised Anxiety Disorder and OCD, and the common traits associated with it. And subsequently all his constant hand-washing, fear of touching surfaces, feeling that the doors are getting contaminated, not letting me and my mother out into the yard without being there to direct us not to touch this or that, not being able to be satisfied with cleaning any 'contaminated' object (door handles, keys, tap knobs etc) even after repeated attempts, et al made sense. I believe he spends a disproportionate amount of time washing his hands even when at home. I believe these are common clinical symptoms of OCD and a phobia of germs. In addition to this, he has always been of a nervous disposition about taking any kind of activity in daily life, which I think could be related to the GAD. It's quite confusing for me as to how to make things better for him and also for me and my mother, because I feel like it's a hindrance to leading a better quality of life.

If you don‚Äôt feel good psychically , it‚Äôs hard to connect the emotions mentally. Sometimes it starts with a tingling, or numb sensation in your face or arms that radiates through your whole body. This causes heart ‚Äúfluttering‚Äù or palpitations. Or a general feeling of anxiousness. 

This leads to a racing mind or a thought process that can‚Äôt be distinguished between emotions such as ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù

I finally got a new job, and I was excited for it. It's in my field, its a commute, and it was a decent paying job. Three close family friends and a close former supervisor all gave me references for this so I felt like I  made them super proud. 
Well, day two of training today. I was told that I had to work an almost 12 hour shift once per work sequence (Sat-Tues), and the overall job description was very different than what I thought it was going to be and I'm not interested in it. I'm also currently in my first semester of grad school, and its midterm season so I am drowning. The training has been super cluttered and confusing, and I began to have an attack during one of the trainings. 
I know that right now I'm not stable enough for everything to be on my plate at once, and I know that this job is not what i thought I'd sign up for. Im luckily in a place that not having a job until December is an option, but i still feel like I'm failing. I had a job for 2 days, and i loved the overall environment and people as well, but it was unstructured and different than what I was offered. I'm also worried about the loved ones who offered character references for me. Im worried I'm letting them down and they'll think less of me for asking them to be my references and then leaving two days later. I'm not sure what to say to them, or what to expect."

1352,poweroverpain, ,0,Anxiety,1605070388,"Medical leave, increased dosage, and still having spikes in heart rate during panic inducing situations (that shouldn't cause panic). Background: I have struggled with anxiety and depression for quite some time. I am a teacher and a coach. Everything seemed to be going well at the beginning of the year, because I found my magical medication combination. Then covid hit, and everything went to hell slowly over time... But it was building and building, and eventually everything became too hard to handle or cope. 

I am dealing with the usual demands and high stress from my job plus the additional stress of teaching and coaching in person and virtual- during a pandemic. 

This past Friday I had a negative meeting with my principal. It was bad... Let's just say he didn't have any tact, and said some cruel and unwarranted things to a struggling teacher. I'm barely keeping my head above water, but I have been pouring my heart and soul into my job and kids on my team. I'm honestly not a bad teacher or coach. I have won teacher of the year, and even a National championship. I take pride in building good relationships with my kids and I love them like they are my own. I am always looking for ways to improve and I am my harshest critic. My family and health has suffered from all of this, but I just kept shoving it down. 

Well the dam broke during the meeting, and I started having a panic attack in the meeting ( so embarrassed). I yelled at my principal y'all! This is very out of character for me. I cried, screamed, argued, defended, told him he was being unfair and irrational, and that we are all going through a lot right now. 

I left the Meeting broken. I went to my room and my coteacher sat with me for 2 hours after school while I just sobbed and sobbed until I could calm down enough to drive home. I spent the weekend in bed hiding under the covers. 

I went home and told my husband what was going on. I took off on Monday to be seen immediately by a therapist and my doctor. 

My original medication was:
-.5 mg Klonopin twice a day
600 mg gabapentin for nerve pain and anxiety up to 3 times a day
60 mg cymbalta
.5 mg of Xanax during panic attacks

She put me on leave for 2 weeks to start and asked me to stop all work for now. My heart rate was sky high in the doctor's office, and it has been like this constant adrenaline feeling for awhile now even with my medicine. I broke down in the doctor's office as well because I am not doing well. 

She upped my medicine to
1 mg Klonopin twice A day
600 mg gabapentin for nerve pain and anxiety up to 3 times a day
60 mg cymbalta
.5 Xanax during panic attacks
50 mg trazadone to sleep

I have been off for one day so I am not expecting miracles and there's only been very minor work things I had to deal with. But I'm trying my hardest to keep these boundaries. 

Tonight I got a text message from my assistant coach, and my heart started racing so bad. I had a doom and gloom feeling. I feel so guilty for leaving her during this time. She wasn't the head coach, and I just threw her into the Lions den. I tried to calm myself down for a few minutes and it wasn't helping. I took my heart rate and it was over 100 resting! I'm usually at 60. 

I was laying in bed when this happened, and I had already taken alllllllll of my medicine about 1.5 hours ago. 

Is this how my body is going to react to everything work related. is this showing me that my body cannot handle this? I'm devastated I'm on medical leave, but clearly I need to make this a priority. I'm not well. 

Do any of y'all have insight or suggestions?"

1362,Cobalt_Caster,Venting,8,Anxiety,1605069185,"My election anxiety turned me into a meme in a subreddit During the 2020 US presidential election, I had a bad time. A really bad time. And I spent a lot of it on the r/fivethirtyeight subreddit. There, in the live threads, I was compelled to respond to any bit of negative news with the overwhelming panic I felt. Really it was absolutely compulsive. It totally consumed me. I spent the entirety of last week unable to sleep or eat. I shook in fear so hard and so long my muscles grew sore. My extremities ran cold no matter what I did.

And every time there was any bad news at all I just immediately freaked out. Eventually they banned me for being obnoxious--which I was--but at that point I was infamous. Through the remaining livethreads people would post ""Cobalt 2024"" or how they needed to send me to the inauguration, or image macros saying ""Oh boy, here I [Cobalt_Caster] go dooming again"" among other things. Personally I find it funny.

What I don't find funny is that the anxiety has remained. It isn't as intense as before, but after the initial relief that the election had turned out how I wanted it to, I found it immediately returned. Then I was scared that the election would be undone, or it would be overturned. And now it's starting to consume me again. Despite knowing better than to give credibility to the possibility, I'm freaking out about a coup. The only reason I'm not on r/fivethirtyeight inflicting my dread on everyone is because I'm still banned.

1371,Tam6443, ,2,Anxiety,1605067404,"Trouble with getting diagnosed Hi guys, so I‚Äôm really new on Reddit and I‚Äôve only read a few topics here. I feel safe being able to do this anonymously.

So basically, I‚Äôve been having trouble figuring out if I have anxiety or not. I know I am an anxious person and I have tried getting a diagnoses but I feel as though the psychiatrist was just dismissing my feelings and it felt like every time I tried to explain my symptoms or what I‚Äôve been experiencing, they would say ‚Äúokay but well talk about that later, that‚Äôs not the focus right now.‚Äù And after that I would just be too scared to mention any other problems. Or I felt like what I was saying was just me being overly dramatic...

In the end of the appointment, the psychiatrist basically diagnosed me with social anxiety, and said that I don‚Äôt have GAD and that my anxiety seems to only be specific to school. But I don‚Äôt think it is because I‚Äôve had panic attacks when i start feeling lonely (I live alone) - an example would be, once my sister came to visit me and it was for 2 days, it felt so nice to have someone else in the house with me and just having company, but once she left, I had a sudden rush of sadness and realization that I was all alone again and started off crying only to start hyperventilating, gagging, shaking or shivers, fast heart beat, cold hands, and basically almost having a panic attack. I also had this feeling of just wanting to curl up, like my chest felt like it was closing in.

I just want to say I have had panic attacks before, but I never knew they were that until I actually checked what symptoms I was experiencing. I had a panic attack when a grasshopper was thrown at me by my cousins and me having a huge phobia of butterflies thought it was one and just ended up breaking down and had the same symptoms.

I also get anxious fairly easily. And tend to overthink situations. I hate being underprepared, I‚Äôm a musician and in my 4th year of Bachelors of Music, and I always feel anxious before a lesson, usually I‚Äôd get cold hands, shivers, or gagging. 

Also I know gagging isn‚Äôt a symptom but it usually happens when I‚Äôm feeling nervous or anxious, I would start gagging and if I don‚Äôt, I just feel like vomiting. 
I told the psychiatrist that I‚Äôve had this gagging thing for like 2 or 3 years now? And it started happening more after my break up wit my ex, he cheated on me and basically after every time someone would talk about him or I‚Äôd hear his name, I would feel so numb and cold and my heart would feel like it was gonna explode and I would start gagging. It was a horrible feeling, but the psychiatrist dismissed it and just said ‚Äúwhat were you afraid of? That he would hurt again, or cheat on you again? That‚Äôs impossible cause you guys broke up already.‚Äù And I explained that it was definitely feelings of anxiousness, not anger or anything but he kept pushing and saying ‚Äúno that doesn‚Äôt make sense, you were probably disgusted and angry‚Äù and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt even express how I felt. 

I felt anxious cause honestly, because he cheated on me, someone I trusted, and every time I was reminded of my ex, I felt so numb and would start gagging. I am 100% sure it was not out of disgust or anger but i felt so scared I would bump into him and talking about him just reminded me of the hurt. It‚Äôs not like that anymore and I was able to overcome it through time but the gagging has stayed and it only happens when I‚Äôm feeling anxious.

I have so much to say, and if someone could please help me figure out if I really do have anxiety? I‚Äôve had 3 panic attacks during midterm seasons and that was during the time my sister came as well, so it was a mixture of stress of school, and the realization of loneliness. I don‚Äôt think I can trust any psychiatrists anymore and I know that not all are bad, but I just have such low expectations after that. 

If you have any questions about what else I‚Äôve experienced regarding anxiety and I‚Äôll answer them. Before I came to the psychiatrist, I had called a doctor about this and they were very polite and were more sympathetic I would say, they mentioned that it did seem like I had anxiety but they also mentioned that I may have mild depression which shocked me. 

I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis but it‚Äôs killing me that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me and that I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm feeling what I‚Äôm feeling. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how bad that psychiatrist appointment was and it‚Äôs bugging me a lot. 

Another background info, before school started, I had been feeling light headed every time I stood up, no energy, no appetite to eat, weak, and overall just depleted, and so I called the doctor to get a blood test to check if I was anemic, I got the results back and it was all normal and the doctors called me saying that my blood was fine but all the symptoms I experienced were related to anxiety, depression, or stress. And this was the beginning of school, like September. I‚Äôve been feeling worse since October started. 

There‚Äôs so many things I want to add but I feel like it‚Äôs too much... so for now.. here is my problem and I just need help figuring out. Are the symptoms I‚Äôm feeling symptoms of anxiety? Cause I really don‚Äôt know"

I don't get it. I have dropped out of this class several times because this is always the first assignment and I literally don't understand how to write it. The textbook says it is an essay about learning to read/write/gain competency in something. It says you should pick a memory about learning to read or write and go from there. There are also a bunch of examples. Then on Blackboard where my professor posts assignments, she says one of the requirements is to have a well-developed thesis statement.  

I don't understand how to write a thesis for a narrative essay. Isn't a thesis statement an argument? What am I supposed to be arguing? I tried to do this in my rough draft and all the peer edits say it sounds more like a persuasive/research essay.

I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for almost a year and a half now, he is absolutely amazing at being patient with my mental health. 

Recently he picked up a ton of extra work and has pretty much been doing hard physical labor almost every single day. 

He usually gets up around 5:15 - 5:30 AM, Monday - Friday and gets home between 3:00 - 5:00 pm which is almost a 12 hour day, then soon after, he disappears into the garage till around 7:30 - 8 pm to finish side jobs. 

This equals to an average of almost 15 hours a day of nonstop work. 

A little over a week ago he started complaining about a numbness feeling and then heart ‚Äúfluttering‚Äù or heart ‚Äúpalpitations‚Äù along with an extreme feeling of dizziness &amp; lightheadedness. 

After about 2-3 days of feeling like this, he started to notice it happens more often while sitting down, laying down, or any kind of ‚Äúrest‚Äù position. 

Slowly it started getting worse and every time he would stand up from a sitting position, he felt like he was going to pass out. 

I finally made him go to our local Walgreens to check his blood pressure which ended up reading :

141 / 81 mmhg which stated it was high.

He tried to go to an urgent care and call a doctor but as soon as he would mention dizziness or heart flutters they would turn him away immediately and tell him to either call 911 or go to the hospital. 

I agreed and told him to go to the emergency room just in case but he refuses and is doing everything he can to avoid going to the hospital. 

I‚Äôm wondering if he is suffering from his very first anxiety or panic attack from all the stress he has been under. 

What do you guys think?

Dizziness and heart fluttering... go to the hospital or wait it out?

His dad has type 2 diabetes and was suspicious of a low sugar level (I am a type 1 diabetic) I checked his sugar after fasting for about 13 hours and it was 92. 2 hours after eating pasta it was 123 so I feel like we can rule out diabetes. 

I forgot to mention that every time we check his blood pressure it ends up being amazing like an athlete except for every once and awhile so I‚Äôm thinking his BP is spiking from stress only."

3. and then let them know whether it's urgent or not

Ever since I \[21M\] started a FWB \[21F\] relationship around early April, I have slowly, but increasingly, been feeling something that can only be best described as a mixture of anxiety, sadness, and loneliness that has caused me to constantly overthink everything and distract me from my work and studies. The sex is great, and usually during and the day after I feel amazing too, but that feeling slowly turns to the mixture of feelings I described before later on in the week. She is an extremely nice girl and I have absolutely no complaints about her as a friend or sexual partner. We are also in the same friend group anyways and we hangout as a group all the time.

I always worry she will change her mind about hooking up with me, worry how I should act around her when I see her again, wonder what she thinks of me and if she has the same feelings that I do, worry that she will find someone else or is already with someone else (since we didn't agree to be exclusive FWBs), and feel sad when I realize that the connection I felt during sex was really just a fake connection (I usually don't have sex with someone I don't have an emotional connection with).

I've speculated on a few reasons why I feel this way. One guess is that I might use sex as a way to fulfill my emotional needs/an emotional void (I have a lot of friends and find it easy to make friends, but I don't have friends I would consider extremely close). Another guess is that I might be developing feelings for her (although I'm not sure why since there are differences in our values/beliefs that made us decide not to pursue a relationship in the first place as well as the fact she is moving across the country to NY in a few months).

If anyone has had similar experiences, did you find out why you felt this way? Maybe it really was one of those reasons I listed? And any advice to stop feeling this way?"

So a few things have happened (at night) in my life in the last 2 years that have led to my anxiety being really bad once it's time for bed, particularly deaths and emergencies at night/early morning hours.

I'm basically at a point now where every night i'm in fear that if I allow myself to fall asleep that something bad will happen and i'll die. I just try and distract myself until i'm tired enough that I can't not fall asleep, but the time it's taking for that to happen is getting longer and longer; i'm not getting as many hours asleep and my anxiety has progressed to anxiety/panic attacks almost nightly, kind of a vicious cycle that is making matters worse.

Today has been extra stressful, I had my first job interview and also my parents are waiting to hear back if they have positive tests for Covid19, i've managed to keep distracted all day but it's caught up with me now that its 2am and I have time to be on my own. I'm  writing all this to distract myself from my current anxiety attack.

I overthink the simplest coordinative tasks and look stupid doing so, because I am afraid of looking stupid in the first place and my body is stiff as hell.

My mind simply doesn't function properly. Let's say there are two objects very near to each other on a desk (one armlength separated from each other). Instead of taking the first object and then reaching for the second without moving, I first reach to the first and then \*walk\* to the second and take it. 

My mind is basically very inefficient at doing the simplest tasks because it doesn't know how to, because it is not on ""automatic"" mode but rather on ""manual"" mode. It's like telling yourself to be conscious about your breath and all of a sudden having a hard time breathing because it feels so forced. 

What can I do to not look stupid? This applies to pretty much everything I do and it's the absolute worst whenever I eat with other people. My mind simply unlearns to eat and I don't know what to do with my fork. This is super embarassing to tell but I even have such pressure that instead of rolling noodles onto my fork I shove them on the fork as if they were something else. It's like I simply don't know what the fuck to do.

This is very intense when I feel observed but it also happens when I observe myself. I'm even afraid of disappointing myself and not being normal, so I somehow internalize that I am indeed not normal and do the weirdest stuff.

I‚Äôve been using journaling for the past 7-8 months to calm my anxiety. I find that when my mind is just exploding with racing thoughts and I‚Äôm not able to calm down with my normal wind-down routine (breathing, no phone etc.) - journaling is that one thing that makes my mind shut up and I‚Äôm able to relax again.

It took me a few months to get the hang of it. When I was starting out, journaling felt so overwhelming because I didnt know What to journal or how to approach it. So I bought some journals that had the same questions every day that focuses on gratitude. It definitely made me more grateful, but that wasnt really my goal. And I got bored of answering the same questions every single day.

The best way to approach it turned out to be just journaling whatever was on my mind, and when I was struggling to find my thoughts, I would use a prompt from the internet like: ¬´I feel the most calm when I...¬ª
That really helped. 
Recipe = whatever on my mind/be inspired by a prompt. 

So for christmas presents this year, I want to gift my loved ones peace of mind. I am planning on making all my friends and family a journal that is like this:

- An introduction to journaling, and why it is effective at calming the mind, the science behind it, and famous people that journal (motivating them to try it out)

- 90 Pages for 90 days of journaling (including Different writing prompts for each day if your struggling with writing) 

- The prompts are all aimed towards calming the mind

Is there anything you would add to make the journal more effective at calming the mind?"

It eventually passed, but ever since I have issues sleeping for maybe one night a week. I'm mostly pretty used to it by now and don't stress too much unless it's more than one night a week bc it makes me anxious if I'm constantly tired. However since a bit before Thanksgiving I've started not being able to sleep for more than 7 hours a night, and the last two nights I've been waking up every half hour for almost the entire night (at least at some point yesterday it stopped and I slept straight through, at the moment I'm taking a break from trying to make myself sleep to make this post so I don't know if it'll go the same way yet).

I know I have trauma related to the holidays from growing up with someone extremely emotionally and verbally abusive who was INSANELY controlling about the holidays. I no longer speak to this person, but about once a year she still tries to reach out around this time and demand to come visit even though she's been cut out just to rock the boat and make everybody miserable. Thankfully this year I already know that she's too afraid of the current global health situation to try and pull anything, but I've been talking to my therapist a lot about the concept of ""physical memories"" and how my body was evolved specifically to remember traumatic events for survival purposes. Meaning that even if I don't consciously remember trauma, my body does and is likely to react with fear. So, naturally, despite being completely safe and happy, I'm struggling with anxiety, and thus my insomnia is back.

My point in making this post is just to vent, I guess, and to ask for reassurance that this is gonna pass. My insomnia last time went away, and I'm sure it will this time too. But it's scary and it would help me a lot to hear kind words from outside my own head.

Not as in them passing away, but I‚Äôm literally spiraling thinking about them getting outside and running away or me getting carjacked while they‚Äôre in the car (this is happening in my city too often).

I‚Äôm dreaming about it, obsessing about it, literally laying in bed almost in tears thinking about it while these sweet dumb animals are snoring next to me.

I‚Äôm currently pregnant, and I‚Äôm already obsessing about the fear of my pets running away when my family watches them when we‚Äôre at the hospital.

1418,yawnyprawny, ,0,Anxiety,1606648407,"New-thing anxiety leading to procrastination. I‚Äôm a trainee lawyer, and I love my job. It‚Äôs challenging, but I get to work with amazingly intelligent people and get to learn something new every day. I‚Äôve also always been an anxious person, but by and large I‚Äôve been able to manage anxiety for the past through years through a combination of mindfulness, exercise and lexapro.

However, I am prone to putting off certain tasks for as long as possible, even when in theory they are tasks I should enjoy doing. I‚Äôve never really been able to understand this part of my own brain until recently.

I realised I don‚Äôt really ever put off tasks that which are very difficult or unpleasant; instead I tend to put off tasks if I don‚Äôt clearly know how to do them. If I can‚Äôt immediately determine the first step in a task, the anxious part of my brain wants to file it away until some future time when the first step is clearer. I‚Äôm by no means lazy - I‚Äôll happily work 12 hour days - but tasks with undefined steps often get ignored. 

The hardest part of being productive, for me, is sitting down with a problem I have no idea how to address and figuring out how to manage it. Even now, I‚Äôm looking at my to-do list and there are some incredibly complex tasks that I feel fine with - like drafting a multi-million euro contract, while there are other much simpler and less time consuming tasks that make my stomach churn when I think about them. Getting over that period of initial stomach-churning ‚ÄòI am so fucking lost‚Äô feeling is the single biggest problem I have when it comes to professional and personal productivity and the biggest source of anxiety. This is hard, because my job requires me handling new things on an almost daily basis.

1443,ryleewu,Discussion,0,Anxiety,1606637054,"An epiphany about control (TW: Mention of suicidality)

I just had an epiphany, thanks to someone who messaged me after I posted to r/SuicideWatch.

My traumatic infancy (fraught with uncontrollability and unpredictability) set the stage for my GAD, and at the heart of that has always been my absolutely desperate need for control. I think that this need goes deeper than I realized. Because now that I think of it, the majority of my maladaptive responses to things are *all about control.*

Right now, there are so many things in my life that I can't control. I am used to panic attacks and physiological anxiety, but I realize now that even my suicidal feelings and impulses come from that control aspect. First, if I can't control an outside thing/person, then at least I can control my life and pain (hence self-harm); and second, I don't want to escape life, I just want to escape the crippling anxiety (masked in anger, sadness, depression, etc.) that is caused by not being able to control everything. Everything that triggers me, everything that is making me so high-strung and dysregulated and unstable and driving my emotions mad, comes down to not being able to control.

I also realize that I have a pattern of letting things beyond my control, control ME. Instead of taking ownership of the things I *can* control, I allow things I *can't* control to define and command my emotions. For years I did this with self-worth: I still hate that I can't control others' opinions of me (i.e. that people can dislike me even if I didn't do anything ""wrong"" or it was a misunderstanding, and I can't change their mind), but I used to therefore allow others' opinions define how I felt about myself. Why? Because I am obsessed with having control. Control is safety and security. Control used to be the difference between life and death--and lack of control was a threat to my life.

Ultimately, my problem is not being able to find happiness when I can't have control, and/or struggling to find smaller things I *can* control even when I can't make everything picture-perfect. I don't know how to be happy or content if there is something in my life that makes me unhappy and I know I'm powerless to change. I'm a rigid thinker, and I have trouble seeing that I could still be happy if I adjusted my perception of a situation, or the importance I assign something, or my expectations. In a workplace capacity, I'm a very creative and flexible thinker and problem-solver. When it comes to my mental health, not at all. Objectively, I know I can either accept that I can't control it (monumentally easier said than done) or leave the situation altogether (also monumentally easier said than done, sometimes). Subjectively, it's hell.

I don't know, I just felt like sharing this. Perhaps it can offer perspective to anyone else here with comorbid issues. It took some time to connect my depression/suicidality/other problems to control, but now I see it much more for what it is."

like so many young adults, getting a job is one of the biggest challenges in your life. Every since I was 17 I sought after a job and always come out flat. I applied for a movie theater and the employees told me to go home and expect a phone call. I never got it. (Well maybe I did and was just too anxious to answer it? I don‚Äôt know) By my 19th birthday my dad took me to a fast food joint. It was my first interview and I was hired on the spot, but I was told to wait for a phone call and they never called me back. Than I try several grocery stores, the last was an hour and a half away from my house and after several interviews the people told me to wait for a phone call. Guess what? No phone call.

After that episode I decided to try out some stay at home jobs like  blogging and freelance writing but they didn‚Äôt turn out as I expected. I watched hours of YouTube videos with thumbnails telling me I can make hundreds of dollars a day doing nothing and they were all big lies. I even try to work with my fathers business at home but the only position he had for me was supervising his social media accounts which was boring.

Finally I decided I‚Äôll do twitch streaming but I needed to wait all year to get a good functioning computer and microphone. after much hesitation, I put in under 10 hours of gameplay on the site and made The discovery that streaming just wasn‚Äôt for me.

I was really upset, all of that wait and complaining was for nothing. ‚ÄúWhere do I go from here?‚Äù I asked myself. How do I support myself while also pursuing my dream of becoming a bestselling writer?

My parents assured me not to worry too much, they‚Äôll support me with whatever job I can find and that they won‚Äôt kick me out of their home or anything like that. however, they did highly recommend that I get something worth a good resum√© like being a waiter or going to college for a higher education and those things I‚Äôm not interested, especially since I‚Äôm kind of a introvert.

I was always sheltered, according to my parents, and that finally ended when I was 16. I got to go to a mental health juvenile detention center, and while there, I found out that our neighbors down the street had been killed in a home invasion the day I left. I was just thinking about it non stop. It could have been our home. We could have driven right past it without knowing what was going on. (The murders happened within a 24 hour time frame of me leaving and them being found. They‚Äôd either been killed that morning, the same time we were leaving, or really late in the night that day.)

I was just starting to get over this when a man up the street was shot to death in his car. I have no idea why, the motive was never announced. Both of these cases I‚Äôve talked about were solved, but I can‚Äôt help but fear it will happen again. 3 murders in my suburban neighborhood in just over a year is a lot to me. I have became so paranoid that I take a gun with me everywhere I go. I know I probably won‚Äôt even have time to react if it happens to me, but keeping that gun with me makes me feel safe. I‚Äôm so paranoid that I sleep fully clothed and then gun in my pocket; if something happens like what happened to my neighbors, there will be no time to reach for the gun safe. (I don‚Äôt keep a round chambered and it is on safety, so I won‚Äôt accidentally shoot myself. I know this is not really a safe way to keep a gun, but it makes me feel safe.) I don‚Äôt know why I still fear this, I don‚Äôt really have a reason to. It‚Äôs been almost 9 months since the last shooting in my neighborhood, so I don‚Äôt think I should still worry. But I obsess over the probability; it‚Äôs rare enough to have a double homicide, but it was right down the street. All 3 were supposedly random, not gang related, not drug related. It was an elderly couple and then a young man. And then there was another, I don‚Äôt know why but I can‚Äôt get it out of my mind and I don‚Äôt feel safe. I just want to have a chance at fighting if it happens to me."

Not the instant random death like car crashes and things like that.  But the slow death that comes as a part of natural life.  It‚Äôs been giving me this constant existential dilemma and fear that I‚Äôll blink and be 80.  Or even worse, reach 40-50 and find out my health is too bad for me to last to my 60‚Äôs.  I want to find a way to turn this into a way of living a healthier more fulfilling life style, but a mixture of (*who‚Äôd have guessed it?*) anxiety, and ADHD have really held back my progress.

I‚Äôm scared that one day I will hit my biggest accomplishment, and it‚Äôll be underwhelming, and then I‚Äôll just get older and die.

That‚Äôs all I want.  I want a way for life to extend beyond death and I‚Äôm hoping science will be crazy enough by then to do it.

1456,zerobyte13,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1606629420,"SSRI experiences/alternatives due to intolerance for Agoraphobia with Panic Disorder? Howdy,

I suffer from C-PTSD comorbid Agoraphobia with Panic Disorder. I also have an intense fear of vomiting. I relapsed into agoraphobia while going through a divorce during the pandemic (that I'm still going through as of this date).

Also, although not an official diagnosis, I strongly believe I suffer from Post Infidelity Stress Disorder, which is due to being cheated on, gaslit, manipulated and so on.

The first two weeks after the divorce decision was made, I could not be alone and my friend took off work for two weeks to stay at home with me. Two months later and I'm able to be at home alone just fine, and I'm able to drive within a few miles of my home.

Specifically, I'm here for medication advice. My doctor tried Paxil at a very low dose last June (which I only took 1/4th of the minimum therapeutic dose). I had night sweats, night terrors, and extreme anxiety on this medication; along with seething rage. We tapered off slowly and I tried CBD for a few weeks with little noticeable impact.

Sidenote, weed just causes me to immediately go into a panic attack (but didn't used to, but I wasn't agoraphobic last December).

I've started Lexapro two nights ago at half the minimum dosage. I'm nauseous constantly and I experienced a panic attack at home like I haven't experienced for months last night. My head feels buzzy and I'm more anxious on this medication.

However, I have started to try using Xanax, which I've had since 2016 and only took once up to this point. I have an rx for 0.5mg and I'm finding 1/4th of a pill is enough to knock out my anxiety so it's tolerable (even last night when it was severe), 0.125mg.

While I know that continued exposure therapy, meditation, good diet and exercise will eventually dig myself out of this hole, considering last time I relapsed it took me two years to get out... what are some other medications I can suggest to my doctor to try?

As useful as I've found Benzos, I'm really reluctant to take them period due to the tolerance and dependency profile.

Am I just super sensitive to medication and need to try an even lower dosage of Lexapro? Do I just need to tough out an SSRI until I know what it's like after 4-6 weeks? What about a beta blocker? I also have slightly high blood sugar and blood pressure.

Thank you for any guidance!"

1460,jac962,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1606628773,"27M ADHDer with previously diagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder, looking for advice on how to deal with chronic/paralyzing overwhelm Hi guys, I visit r/ADHD a lot because it‚Äôs my main diagnosis but I wanted to get some insight on how you guys deals with chronic overwhelm (TL;DR at bottom because this is a longer post). I‚Äôm diagnosed with ADHD-inattentive type and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in my teenage years. My psych evals from elementary school diagnosed me with ‚ÄúADHD with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and preoccupation with worry‚Äù. I am take medication for my ADHD (Vyvanse 40mg daily) but have never been medicated for anxiety. I have been in long-term therapy for the last year and a half. Due to some of my past struggles with job/school performance, my anxiety mostly occurs when it‚Äôs related to ‚Äúwhat I need to do/should be doing‚Äù. 

I use a bullet journal to keep a list of the things I need to do on a daily/monthly/someday-in-the-future basis. It helps me stay organized but it also puts me in a chronic state of overwhelm. I constantly reflect on how much I want to do in life and I feel like I‚Äôm always behind. My ADHD makes it difficult to start even short-term tasks so my long-term tasks usually end up getting put on the back burner. When I am able to start a task, my perfectionist tendencies make it difficult to finish them in any reasonable amount of time. So a month will go by and I‚Äôll look back on my monthly ‚Äúfuture goal‚Äù list and I just get completely overwhelmed because 75-85% of my monthly goals didn‚Äôt get done. 

I know there are a lot of factors here, some of it is probably me being too ambitious with my goals and not being realistic about the free time I have. On the other hand, I know I get easily distracted and I can throw away 4 hours no problem. Whether it‚Äôs with obvious time-wasters like video games, or ‚Äúseemingly productive‚Äù tasks like writing the perfect email to a client. Either way, the results are the same in that I spend almost 100% of my day worrying and ruminating about what ‚Äúshould be doing‚Äù. These thoughts are conscious and I‚Äôm cognizant of them even while I‚Äôm engaging in a time-wasting activity watching (playing around on phone, Netflix, etc.). And because I take longer than the average person to complete basic tasks, my day usually ends with me berating myself for not doing what I set out to do. For example, I wanted to cook dinner tonight. I told myself all day I would cook. I played video games and played around on my phone while telling myself I needed to cook dinner for hours and never ended up making it. That is a typical day for me. Ruminating about doing a task while (seemingly) compulsively engaging in a time-waster, which ultimately leads to unhappiness and stress while doing the time-waster, leading to even more overwhelm, as well as regret and guilt/shame. Not very productive! 

I‚Äôm working on a lot of this in therapy which helps. Most of what we work on is behavioral and incorporating good habits i.e. good sleep, daily exercise, wait healthy, etc. which have all gotten better. I just can‚Äôt shake the constant feeling of chronic overwhelm and feeling like I‚Äôm always behind in my day-to-day and with my future goals. As I said before, I visit r/ADHD a lot but haven‚Äôt visited this subreddit very often and I‚Äôm just hoping to get some insight. Do you guys experience anxiety in this way as well? What have you guys found that helps with coping with these feelings? I‚Äôve never been on anxiety meds but sometimes (more often than not) the overwhelm is so strong that it‚Äôs paralyzing. Any feedback or insight is appreciated üòå

TL;DR- ADHDer in therapy and chronically overwhelmed, mostly by seeing my ‚Äúto-do‚Äù lists, to the point where it becomes paralyzing and I will waste time while simultaneously ruminating about the tasks that I should be doing instead. Looking for advice on how to cope with these feelings and not be as hard on myself for not having all of my ‚Äúto-do‚Äôs‚Äù done. Interested in how medication has or hasn‚Äôt helped you guys with chronic overwhelm and if so which medications you found helpful (and not helpful)."

Going to therapy/counselling is also amazing (if you can access it). These are all GREAT coping mechanisms for your tool box!

That being said, if you've never tried, please do **self-directed CBT** (abundance resources on google - **""CBT worksheets""**). It is recommended to do an hour session once a week for 12-20 weeks. Keep those tools you learn in your self-directed therapy with you throughout your day and *practice, practice, practice*. 

CBT is evidence-based and used to treat a broad range of psychiatric disorders. It has a success rate of 75%+ or higher (and that's just within 12-20 weeks!). 

Remember, you are not in control of your thoughts (we think 1.6 thoughts/second, 99% of them are meaningless). You are in control of your REACTION and your ATTITUDE towards your thoughts. Another tool I use to ask myself: ""Who would I be without this worry?""

Crosspost Hi everyone, so I wanted to get some thoughts and opinions here. In the past I had no problem having a few drinks on 20mg prozac on the weekends to unwind and chill out, just at home playing videogames, that type of thing. 

I got off 20mg prozac this summer after a year and it was a disaster, so my doctor put me back on 20mg with no titration and of course I dealt with side effects for a month. I'm at six weeks today, and had a few drinks after I got home from the gym and did some chores thinking I'd just chill and play videogames. Instead I'm extremely anxious and depressed, with extremely dark thoughts (not contemplating suicide) but thinking ""oh hey, I wouldn't be too entirely angry if I got hit by a bus next time I'm out"" and that's really really unlike me. (I've had some increased anxiety and depressive thoughts the last few days but nothing like this, but those were sober so???)

I also intermittently take trazodone 100mg for sleep. 

Does anyone have any explanation? I had 7 drinks in the span of 7 hours. I think tomorrow I'm just sticking to water &amp; seltzer water. Just curious why I've been feeling so down lately and especially today?

The last months have been a wild ride. I spoke often and freely about me taking meds, seeing a therapist, feeling like crap, having panic attacks, bad anxiety.

My family, my coworkers, my boss.

You see, growing up, the subject of mental illness, psychology and psychiatry equaled the ""nut house"". A psychiatrist was only for the severely mentally disabled. If someone was seeing a psychologist, it meant that that person was gravely ill, crazy.

These issues were taboo. Very taboo.

At first, many of my family members opposed the idea of me taking meds. They found the idea of going to therapy really strange. The people around me found it kind of weird that I'm going through all of this and didn't mention anything about it. Only me. 

One day, my boss told me he went to therapy for 2 years after his father died. The other day, I caught my coworker talking about someone they know who had panic attacks. Yesterday, my office boss actually joked about it. It wasn't offensive or anything, just a plain innocent joke. 

Another coworker felt comfortable enough to tell me about his schizophrenic older brother who still acts like a kid, how he'd wish they'd went sledding when there was still snow. 

My mom now asks how therapy went, what I've learned, how I'm feeling, if meds are still making me feel weird. My sister who has depression and panic disorder asked for my therapist's phone number because she wants to go as well. I talk to her often about this and our feelings. I tell her what therapy had taught me. 

I'm using what I've learned to help my daughter face her own fears and anxieties

My mind is against everything I try to feel when I try to feel happy (or suddenly I get happy of something) I lose that happy feeling to the fear response or any other feeling these days. 

Everytime I try to be positive my mind does this automatic fear response to that feeling and I lose that positive emotion (or any emotion) suddenly. I like forget what I did feel and it becomes more and more exhausting the more fear and panic attacks I get. 

I have been fighting to my anxiety for a long time but it becomes stronger and stronger and it causes to make me exhausted and when I try to find something positive the fear is always fighting me back which numbs my positive feeling.

I am very afraid or I am trying to be. I feel like I am not going to feel any emotion ever again. And I just want to die but I don‚Äôt even feel like dying. 

This is only getting worse. I am getting a doctor of some sort next monday but I think it isn‚Äôt going to help.

So a few nights ago I decided I was going to have 2 glasses of wine to mute or muffle the anxiety narrative and to help me sleep.

I woke the next day feeling scared and ashamed and shocked at how close I'd come.

The thing about anxiety is that you feel you absolutely must cope all the time so to do that, I guess I push all other feelings away and just refuse to feel them because if I do then I'll fall apart and I won't function well and that is the bedrock of my anxiety.

I don't know if this has been asked before and if it has I apologize, I tried searching the sub for it and didn't seem to find anything like what I am looking for. 

I imagine I am not the only one on this sub that deals with this, but when I am anxious about an event I will have dreams leading up to it. Oftentimes these are stress dreams, and I wake up feeling more anxious... and often times these dreams feel very real. The problem I am facing is that then when the time comes to be at that event, I am significantly more anxious than I should be partially because I just think about that thing happening. Or at the very least, my anxiety will spike because even if I am consciously not thinking about it my subconscious seemingly is. 

Oftentimes, my dreams like this involve failing in some way. And honestly having those kinds of images and thoughts in my head during my time to do whatever it is (for example this time it happens to be student interning in a classroom because I'm in school to be a teacher) it just makes me more nervous and more likely to mess up. I am petrified that one of these days it's going to cause a panic attack at the place/ event. 

Does anybody have any ideas to not focus on these dreams so much? Or to convince myself they won't happen, despite them being possible, at least technically? I don't think I can stop the dreams but honestly if anyone has any ideas on that I'm all ears as well. 

Thanks in advance everyone who reads this/tries to answer it.

It‚Äôs even more shameful knowing that it was community college, which is basically ‚Äúeasy mode‚Äù for the average person. 

I only lasted a year and a half at my previous job at Whole Foods before I stupidly quit and spent all of 2020 jobless. I finally applied to several places last year, mostly pharmacies since I wanted to keep trying for a career in a healthcare-related field. Nobody responded back except for one, who didn‚Äôt hire me after one interview. 

I finally got pulled into a retail pharmacy inside a grocery store. Spent almost a month doing courses on the computer. Attempted the final exam and I got 76%, about 4% away from the passing grade. I have been devastated since then. I haven‚Äôt left the house and have been having crying episodes and bombarded with negative self talk. I haven‚Äôt told my family anything but I know if I did they would be even more disappointed in me. Not even encouraging words from my s/o or long distance friends are helping me.

I know that, for the most part, these thoughts are frivolous. Yes my dog will one day pass, but constantly fretting changes nothing. I‚Äôm fairly sure these are called intrusive thoughts.

1552,nPain9,Medication,8,Anxiety,1611373767,"Can medication be a long term fix for anxiety for some people, even after they stop taking it? I have very bad social anxiety / performance anxiety in certain situations, and it is highly based on physical symptoms and a fear of them escalating to where others notice. Usually they do escalate and it‚Äôs all I can focus on in the moment.  

Let‚Äôs say I take any medication for anxiety for a certain amount of time, such as anywhere from a month to a year. I may be on an SSRI that is effective for me, maybe a beta blocker, maybe a benzodiazepine. The bottom line is that I‚Äôm on something that is really helpful for me. During my time taking this medication, I experience a lot of scenarios that once would‚Äôve been horrible, but they go by very well because of my medication. Now after having barely any anxiety and having experienced undeniable confidence repeatedly, I stop taking the medication or taper off of it. At this point, is there a chance that I could have permanently been ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, or significantly benefitted in terms of my symptoms and continue to do well medication-free?  

What I‚Äôm doing here is I‚Äôm comparing exposure therapy with medication. Are experiences while taking medication useful at all in terms of growing confidence and lessening anxiety in situations that induce anxiety? Or is exposure therapy and its results dependent on the fact that you are experiencing anxiety, and it‚Äôs taking your brainpower to overcome the anxiety over time?  
Another question I have that stems off of this is whether anxiety medication in general can just permanently ‚Äúfix‚Äù somebody‚Äôs anxiety, even after they quit taking it. I‚Äôm aware that this is not a common thing that just happens to people and there is no known 100% cure out there, but can this happen to some people? Can a medication work so well for a person that it just permanently rewires their brain? I‚Äôve heard of some good results for some people with medications that are somewhat still experimental, such as ketamine, but is anything like this reported with a certain few who are taking other more common medications such as the classes I stated before (SSRI, SNRI, benzodiazepines, etc.)?"

I am not close to my family, I live alone, and I work from home. As the vaccine rollout picks up, I'm becoming more and more anxious. I've had chest pain all week.

Before, I was paranoid that people were stalking me. I was seeing things, hearing things, and generally just struggling. I'm afraid to go back to that. Although I still have symptoms, it's clear now that PEOPLE were severely exacerbating my symptoms. I just want to make enough money to go live alone in solitude (I live in a big city).

I tried going to therapy a few months ago. I thought I could change, but I just can't trust anyone. I can't trust a therapist. They kept telling me to see a psychiatrist. I finally have an appointment next month but why? I'm already on an antidepressant and I helps. I don't want more medication. I already know what's wrong with me and I can't change. Is there a point?

We are currently long distance partners and have been for our 18 month relationship, and she's also struggling with lockdown.  She usually gets really down due to a trigger, so for example today she had a good day, went for a walk, worked from home, tried on a new top which she had ordered and was pleased with it. However, later she tried in a new wig (for representing a brand on social media), and she felt she looked disgusting and spiraled to the point when she was questioning whether I loved her, she doesn't deserve anyone, deserves to be alone and said she doesn't know how to be a person. This last part is what scares me, she has repeatedly over the last few months questioned how to function as a person and she feels like she's acting in someone's body. But then I'll sit and video call her for a few hours and reassure her, and she'll eventually calm down and the next day she's fine.  We have been together 18 months and she has struggled with friendships and relationships, and felt like she has been walked over, used and abandoned.

13 years later, I thought I had beat this coping mechanism and my hair has been long again for about a year. But then the past few months I feel everything going downhill (personal, professional, relationships- just everything). I am constantly catastrophizing every tiny decision and having panic attacks more and more often.

And I'm chewing again. 

My neckline and sleeves, my hair (was chewing on it intermittently without realizing it while talking- the person was nice enough not to say anything but once I realized I had been doing it after the conversation, I went into the bathroom and cried), pencils, the edges of cups, buttons, zippers, my nails. 

I am incredibly ashamed of it- I've added it to my cycle of worries that pops in when I'm not blasting constant stimulation into my system to avoid thinking about it too much. I've confided in few others about this and have been met with ""It's just a bad habit- just break it"". It's not.

And all because I came across right-winged orthodox shitposters online. 

Relatively, I was doing great today. I was motivated, organized, I got my work done. And then I just had to scroll through Facebook, I come across one of those just spectacular mysoginistic threads full of pepe-infested orthodox shitposters who all have matching MAGA profiles and are larping as the most offensive fascist possible, and I went into shut-down mode.

When I get like this, I look for any possible way to release the anxiety, fear, and anger that boils up inside me. If I dont, I start down a rabbit hole of researching things online related to religious trauma. This has been happening more frequently this week as my state moves closer to passing their version of the Fetal Heartbeat anti-abortion bill. I feel no relief from the actions of insufferable religious authoriatians, I feel anxious from their relentless hatred spewed in every social space I know of. Their rapid radicalization scares me, their hypocritical bigotry enrages me, their boldness fuels my anxiety about the future. I ended up down a rabbit hole of reading about orthodox church mysoginy, their relationship to fascism, abuse in the church, which lead me to reddit threads about religious trauma, which lead me here. I was seeking any shred of rationality to help center me, and I ended up making things worse for myself.

My coping methods I learned through therapy dont work as well when it comes to the subject of reproductive freedoms and religious trauma.

Idk if this helps, but I'm a 21M.

None of my previous relationships ended really ""messy"" per-say. I could talk to any of them now, and I'd consider them my friend. But in all but one of them, the other party ended things. In one event particular, and my last relationship, my girlfriend ended things because she felt bad that I loved her, and she didn't feel the same way back. I think this event in particular was especially scarring for me.

Essentially the way all of my previous relationships/flings have ended, have culminated in me in having a  low view of myself. Sometimes I feel as though once someone gets to know me they'll realize they don't like me, and leave. I know I should look at situations like that like: ""Oh there's nothing wrong with you, they just weren't interested in you"", but sometimes I can't help but conjure a self-loathing view of myself. It can either be based on my personality, or my appearance. 

I feel like I'm a likable person, who's also attractive. But when I start engaging with someone who I am attracted to now, I can't help but have doubtful thoughts, and I the thought ""They don't want you, they want someone who's more muscular/confident/successful/etc.."" enters my mind.

I have a date this Sunday in which I'm meeting up with a girl who goes to my college. For the most part I'm super excited, but I've had some anxiety. She's someone who does a lot of lifting, so she's pretty strong and muscular. I only really got into working out about a year ago, so I'm still quite slim, and this conception of her not wanting me because I'm not big enough has been creeping into my mind.

In second grade I realized not everyone felt this sense of dread and the constant worry of every single thing that could or would possibly happen. As a young child I was known as the class clown but as the years went by I knew this consistent pressure on my chest, sweaty hands, the inability to sleep due to my racing head, always doubting myself, and feeling trapped were not normal. The first time I tried to seek help was in sixth grade and I decided I couldn't take it anymore and talked to a counselor. Obviously, a counselor isn't a therapist but I couldn't just stand there and just let my mind kick my ass every day.

I hated the idea of seeking help but with my self worth down the drain, I decided why not. I talked with her for a week until she told me she had to tell my parents and I felt the color drain from my face. I was always the happy person around everyone and was terrified of what my parents would think. She called my parents and when I got home all hell broke loose. My parents told me everyone felt anxious at one point in life and that I was over my head. They said that only crazy people are happy all the time. As tears slipped into my dinner I decided to just return my mask of happiness to hide my sorrow.

A few years after that, my anxiety worsened and every day was a battle. I again decided to talk to a counselor and told her I didn't want her to tell my parents and she agreed. I took her into my confidence and yet again another counselor told me that they needed to tell my parents ( I had not said anything about hurting me or others ). As I got home my mother started yelling at me at how terrible of a daughter I was and I was so obsessed with myself I had somehow convinced myself I had a disorder. I begged for professional help and that I'd even find a job to pay for it. She told me to get over it and I just went up to my room to sob in silence.

With a sense of defeat, I decided to do anything to try to ground myself and or soothe myself. In the beginning, it was overindulging in food, which made me gain a lot of weight. It made me feel even worse about my self-worth but it made me feel a little bit better which was better than nothing. After seeing how much weight I had gained I stopped eating which started the history of my eating disorder which is another story for a different time. I quickly lost a tremendous amount of weight and became extremely skinny. I knew what I was doing was wrong but I was addicted to the empty feeling in my stomach and it was something I could feel grounded for once. After that was the cigarette addiction which gave me a 1-minute break from my head which was enough to convince me to start using. After that was self-harming.

I started to cut myself to try to make everything seem all right and then came the idea that maybe life wasn't it for me. That all this suffering wasn't worth it and that the pain would all disappear if I just end it. I decided before I die before I make this unchangeable action to myself to at least try some things. I had tried about a million things to find a way to help my anxiety such as baths, journaling, church, exercising, free online therapists, etc. It seemed like the only thing I didn't try was meditation and in hindsight, it seemed kind of odd. Just sitting there swimming in your thoughts and trying to focus on your breathing. It seemed almost counteractive. But again who was I to judge it, someone who was truly thinking of ending it so I did it. 

I sat there and just focused on my breathing for about ten minutes and when I opened I felt something that seemed impossible, tranquility. I started crying of happiness not believing that something so simple could be the answer to years and years of pain. I sat there experiencing what I thought I could only experience in death. This was a few months ago and now I've been enjoying life with appreciating things I couldn't if I were in a grave. The birds singing in the morning or the sun kissing my cheeks. Meditating wasn't a simple fix to my entire life of course but it gave me something to cope with. I'm learning to deal with past traumas and how to deal with life. I owe meditating to saving my life and I wanted to write this to help others. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be here today.

In second grade I realized not everyone felt this sense of dread and the constant worry of every single thing that could or would possibly happen. As a young child I was known as the class clown but as the years went by I knew this consistent pressure on my chest, sweaty hands, the inability to sleep due to my racing head, always doubting myself, and feeling trapped were not normal. The first time I tried to seek help was in sixth grade and I decided I couldn't take it anymore and talked to a counselor. Obviously, a counselor isn't a therapist but I couldn't just stand there and just let my mind kick my ass every day.

I hated the idea of seeking help but with my self worth down the drain, I decided why not. I talked with her for a week until she told me she had to tell my parents and I felt the color drain from my face. I was always the happy person around everyone and was terrified of what my parents would think. She called my parents and when I got home all hell broke loose. My parents told me everyone felt anxious at one point in life and that I was over my head. They said that only crazy people are happy all the time. As tears slipped into my dinner I decided to just return my mask of happiness to hide my sorrow.

A few years after that, my anxiety worsened and every day was a battle. I again decided to talk to a counselor and told her I didn't want her to tell my parents and she agreed. I took her into my confidence and yet again another counselor told me that they needed to tell my parents ( I had not said anything about hurting me or others ). As I got home my mother started yelling at me at how terrible of a daughter I was and I was so obsessed with myself I had somehow convinced myself I had a disorder. I begged for professional help and that I'd even find a job to pay for it. She told me to get over it and I just went up to my room to sob in silence.

With a sense of defeat, I decided to do anything to try to ground myself and or soothe myself. In the beginning, it was overindulging in food, which made me gain a lot of weight. It made me feel even worse about my self-worth but it made me feel a little bit better which was better than nothing. After seeing how much weight I had gained I stopped eating which started the history of my eating disorder which is another story for a different time. I quickly lost a tremendous amount of weight and became extremely skinny. I knew what I was doing was wrong but I was addicted to the empty feeling in my stomach and it was something I could feel grounded for once. After that was the cigarette addiction which gave me a 1-minute break from my head which was enough to convince me to start using. After that was self-harming.

I started to cut myself to try to make everything seem all right and then came the idea that maybe life wasn't it for me. That all this suffering wasn't worth it and that the pain would all disappear if I just end it. I decided before I die before I make this unchangeable action to myself to at least try some things. I had tried about a million things to find a way to help my anxiety such as baths, journaling, church, exercising, free online therapists, etc. It seemed like the only thing I didn't try was meditation and in hindsight, it seemed kind of odd. Just sitting there swimming in your thoughts and trying to focus on your breathing. It seemed almost counteractive. But again who was I to judge it, someone who was truly thinking of ending it so I did it. 

I sat there and just focused on my breathing for about ten minutes and when I opened I felt something that seemed impossible, tranquility. I started crying of happiness not believing that something so simple could be the answer to years and years of pain. I sat there experiencing what I thought I could only experience in death. This was a few months ago and now I've been enjoying life with appreciating things I couldn't if I were in a grave. The birds singing in the morning or the sun kissing my cheeks. Meditating wasn't a simple fix to my entire life of course but it gave me something to cope with. I'm learning to deal with past traumas and how to deal with life. I owe meditating to saving my life and I wanted to write this to help others. Otherwise, I'm not sure I'd be here today.

I luckily graduated this past summer and was struggling to get a job because of lack of experience and because of doing shit in interviews because of my beloved anxiety. I love you anxiety. Anyways I ended up somehow getting a job but I didn‚Äôt even have a proper interview, it was just a video interview. And it‚Äôs a job from home, ringing people that have tested positive with COVID and asking them questions, where they caught it and who they might have spread it to. Well anyways this job has gave me a lot of anxiety and I have been messing it up bad and I‚Äôm worried I will get fired for doing this bad on these calls. 

Summer was good, meeting up with friends nearly everyday, smoking weed, partying, etc. However, I noticed I was getting addicted to weed and I stopped and noticed how my friends were a bad influence and they never do anything actually productive. It‚Äôs just all weed and partying and things like that. Now that I quit weed they stopped meeting me and also I‚Äôve heard today that they have possibly been arrested but I don‚Äôt know if this is anything serious or not. 

Well anyways, this has made me feel so alone, having no real friends, and the friends I had were a bad influence and they had completely different goals than me. I always wanted to travel the world, I love travelling, however, I‚Äôve never met anyone that likes travelling like I do so I can‚Äôt even travel. I could make new friends and I should, however, my anxiety makes it so difficult plus I work at home so can‚Äôt even meet friends from working. So basically I have no one to travel with and also have no one that can actually support me with my mental health. My friends weren‚Äôt aware of my actual anxiety because they‚Äôd laugh at it.

Hi...

I have struggled on/off with anxiety since 8th grade, along with depression, suicidal ideations, and self harm. From fall 2018-fall 2019, I got a lot better and was mentally the healthiest I‚Äôd been in years. Then COVID hit in March. I‚Äôm in my early 20s now, have just graduated, and have been working in healthcare the last 2.5 years. This past semester was by far the most difficult and I burnt out. Combined with facing COVID first hand and civil unrest (I live in Minneapolis). 

I‚Äôve tried a lot so far: meditating, daily walks, reading, listening to music, watching tv, petting my dog, crying it out, snapping a rubber band on my wrist, taking a hot shower, writing it out... but it feels all temporary and I feel like the world is moving forward while I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôm also limited because of the cold weather and trying to be careful because of COVID. I only have 1, maybe 2, people who actually like me for me. Everybody else isn‚Äôt so understanding and if I stop being fun or exciting, I‚Äôm lame and shrugged off. Who wants to deal with a depressed girl who‚Äôs sensitive as fuck? I feel like mental health is glamorized and everybody repeats that it‚Äôs important, but when it comes down to it, nobody wants an extra burden in their life. I recently actually made a new friend around New Years and we really hit it off (platonically). In his words, I‚Äôm a fun, smart, successful person. He‚Äôs a nurse and he seemed like a caring and kind person. He even brought up hanging out (socially distanced). But as soon as I hit a slump and stopped meeting those expectations, his replies have been one word or just emojis. Or he‚Äôll leave me on read when he used to respond quickly throughout the day and we‚Äôd have full conversations. 


I‚Äôm so used to being thrown aside. And I feel even more broken despite all the progress I had made. I took so many steps backwards. I‚Äôm in the middle of switching therapists but I know my PHQ-9 score has gone from 8-10 to 15+ and I have multiple crying spells a week or multiple a day. Before, I would go a couple months before having an anxiety attack. Now it‚Äôs so much more common and negative urges have come back into my brain. I‚Äôll be clean from cutting for 2 years if I make it to March, but all I want to do is just never wake up."

During Covid I've been helping watch my 3 nieces (their parents both have to be in-person at work). Today my oldest niece asked to talk to me and for a straight hour sobbed talking about how much she's struggling right now (school, body image - her mom has a complicated relationship with food, Covid in general, the days I'm not there she has to be the one making sure her two younger sisters get on their class Zooms in time/get homework done, the general difficult experience of being a teenager). And then she started telling me about her high levels of anxiety, the constant second-guessing of everything you do in social situations, the picking at the scalp, the need to make sure no one is ever angry at you, panic attacks, sensory issues, and more.

From what she told me her mother constantly trivializes it and tells her that ""everyone deals with stress"", acts like she's being overdramatic, gets mad at her when she comes to her asking for support, tells her it's because of (insert blame here), says things like ""well just stop doing X then"".

My sister called me on my way home and I told her that my niece was struggling and would likely ask to see a therapist(I kept it unspecific so I didn't betray my niece's confidence). My sister trivialized all of it and said that my niece blows things out of proportion and that you know small things are such a big deal to her, and then complained that my niece refuses to open up to her and her husband. **And I just wanted to scream.**

Like **how dare you** be offended that she won't talk to you when you constantly trivialize literally everything she‚Äôs telling you/try and explain it all away/tell her she's being dramatic/tell her to just stop being anxious. And I know she and her husband are both doing their best and trying to manage 3 kids, full-time jobs, their own mental health, etc. and I realize the truth is probably somewhere in the middle and some of my niece's experience is also likely influenced by the anxiety (and the warped perception anxiety can give us sometimes).

But I am just so angry. Like it is VERY obvious that this isn't a normal level of stress, and not just ""hormones"" or her being an insecure teenager. There's something big going on, and so much of it was exactly my experience in high school before I was diagnosed and before I was medicated and I just recognize how my sisters behavior is EXACTLY what my parents did - which sometimes I feel like fucked me up even more than the actual anxiety and depression.

I don't want to overstep, and I know that I don't understand what it's like to be a parent but I'm just watching this poor kid struggle just like I did and seeing my sister make the same mistakes and saying that they'll wait it out and see if she ""really does need one"" (it's not for financial reasons either). Just because she's able to kind of cope and isn't struggling in a way that seems realistic to them.

No one **really** paid attention to me until I hit rock bottom. I wish I had someone to advocate for me when I was a kid. If I had gotten a therapist and been medicated earlier so much of my life would have turned out different. I just don't know how to do that without also ruining my relationship with my sister."

You CAN rid yourself of these awful feelings and feel better! Do not lose hope! Anyway, here are the symptoms of anxiety that plagued me.....

* Sweaty/Clammy hands
* Headaches/tension and tightness in my head
* Heart palpitations/feeling like a missed heartbeat. I would always cough when this would happen.
* Eye twitch and sometimes a twitch in the temple region
* Shallow breathing. This was a big one for me and unfortunately shallow breathing comes with other negative symptoms like dizziness and chest pains.
* Very alert of my own thoughts and self. Living inside my own head far too much.
* Difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. I was able to help this issue when I started using a fan every night.
* I would find myself randomly having a beer or whiskey at 10PM on a Tuesday, just to try and relax. (And I do not drink much in general)
* Rapid heartbeat but even more than that I was VERY aware of my heartbeat.
* Intrusive thoughts. This was an odd and scary symptom. My girlfriend at the time, who I loved very much, but yet I would have these thoughts like what if i hit her over the head with my baseball bat!? Like WTF? Where do these outrageous and disturbing thoughts even come from.
* Inability to just feel comfortable and relax. Something as simple as watching sports/tv show/movie was nearly unbearable.
* Fidgety and often in a fog
* Periods of extreme shaking
* Avoided places where an easy exit was not possible. (Still do this)
* Lack of solid number 2's
* Did not feel comfortable leaving my house. Because ""what if my anxiety embarrassed me in public.""
* Damaged relationships/friendships due to not going out much and not wanting to see anyone.
* Healthy eating to combat my healthy anxiety. Was always researching for foods best for your heart because I was convinced my heart was bad and rotting.
* Drank a lot of water at times because I felt some relief when doing so.
* Small talk (especially with co-workers) caused a high degree of anxiety. Sweaty, light headed, tingly almost immediately.
* I did not like being within 10 miles of my house and ""comfort zone"". (A year before this all started I flew to Mexico)
* I use to do silly things like fake being on the phone while walking through the mall because that would help with anxiety.

I also feel like I can‚Äôt measure up to even a quarter of the girls I see online in terms of looks...

Recently, nearly every day I feel sick because of my anxiety/depression. Particularly when I need to eat. Just chewing food can sometimes make me want to throw up. On two occasions it did make me throw up. Not even dry foods help, just the chewing alone is awful. It‚Äôs mainly worse in the mornings or when I‚Äôm in situations that raise my stress and anxiety levels. For example I struggle to eat on dates without wanting to puke. It stops me from eating a lot which gives me more anxiety about losing weight (I am already incredibly skinny and cannot afford to lose weight).

I just want to try and live my life, but the constant anxiety makes me feel miserable. Sometimes to the point where I even get suicidal thoughts.

I'm coach and hypnotherapist with a focus on helping people who are using psychedelics or microdosing for anxiety, so that they can get the most out of the experience and really make a change for the better. I'm currently building courses around this, and I've had some really great results for myself and the people I've worked with.

But I'd like to get more input from fellow Anxiety sufferers. And so, I'd love to hear your experiences --good or bad-- in terms of how psychedelics have fit into your experience of Anxiety.

Here's the kinds of things I'm curious about. Asking so that I can really address the common issues people are facing:  
Are you currently microdosing?   
If so, hows it been for you? Any challenges or recurring issues with this approach?   
Did you have experience with psychedelics before you started microdosing?  
Has it helped your anxiety? Worsened it?  
When you cycle off of microdosing, are the effects staying with you?

And any general thoughts, impressions, or observations would be very much welcomed. If you'd rather DM me and let me ask you a few questions about it, that would be cool too. Wishing everybody here peace and ease."

My current situation is I am working full time at a job that is kind of stressful. It‚Äôs not what I want to do or makes me happy but it pays the bills - for the most part. Ive been out of college for 3 years. I moved out my parents recently (they can be toxic sometimes) for my mental health and to be closer in commute (had a two hour one way commute at times) even though it has helped me tremendously, I can barely save with living in my apt. I also just got into what I consider a dream school and dream opportunity but it‚Äôs giving me a lot of anxiety because it‚Äôs adding on $50k + to my already 80k of student loan debt. I also have a lot of credit card debt that I‚Äôm trying to pay down and due to reasons of the past... living super far, my leased car is over on miles already and it‚Äôs up in December (long story but it was not my choice to lease this car but I‚Äôm stuck with the payments) I‚Äôve taken antidepressants and hated them. I don‚Äôt want to want live this stressed out and I am even considering enrolling out of grad school before it begins cause I worry about becoming more stressed and stressed financially-but I don‚Äôt want to do that. I also dislike where I live a lot but I cannot afford to change it right now so I‚Äôm just stuck. My whole situation wasn‚Äôt something I expected and it‚Äôs already has caused me a lot of mental anguish and stress. I ask for advice from people that know my situation... the only thing that works for me is just handling my day to day but it prevents me from planning for a stable future without having anxiety and it just makes me feel unhappy. It sucks because I‚Äôm surrounded by so many people who don‚Äôt have these issues to this extent and don‚Äôt know what to do. sos?

I‚Äôve done so many things already in the past three years to help myself, like work multiple jobs, have side hustles... it‚Äôs just that I feel like this is something I‚Äôll have to deal with for a long time to stay afloat and I don‚Äôt want to be 50 to finally feel like I can do something other than work ugh idk if I‚Äôm just fearing too much but it‚Äôs mentally exhausting and effecting me in many different ways."

1657,motherofkitties86, ,2,Anxiety,1608231816,"Not Sure How To Deal This is my first time ever posting anything- much less venting about my depression and anxiety. So if you are even reading this, it means I managed to actually post it instead of just deleting halfway through. My thoughts aren‚Äôt especially organized so I‚Äôll do the best I can to express myself. 

I‚Äôve always had issues with my anxiety and depression but because I could step away from situations that cause friction I could self manage. This year has been especially hard. 

I went from working 40 hours a week outside the home to trying to put in 20 hours a week for my current job (I‚Äôm a medical coder/office billing manager) all while helping my kindergartener remote learn and keeping my 2 year old entertained. They are good kids but like most adults, they are tired of being home and only seeing certain people. 

I‚Äôve been stuck in a shitty situation  with my job for some time now - The owner/boss calls/texts me at all hours of the day and expects me to answer regardless of the time. He‚Äôs the type of person who doesn‚Äôt believe in masks and only recently enforced staff (yes you read that correctly) to wear them because a patient called our local health department and reported him. And just to clarify this is a medical practice that sees anywhere from 20-30 patients a day - also with no mask requirements until recently. There is added pressure because the practice isn‚Äôt doing well - he made some bad decisions prior to my employment and I have been trying to clean up the subsequent messes for the past 4 years. So there is added pressure to get things done - while receiving random protocol changes whenever he fancies. I haven‚Äôt had raise in 3 years and yet I‚Äôve taken on more work - short of seeing a patient or prescribing meds I can do anything in the office. My opinions and knowledge are not respected until after the fact so I find myself making decisions above my pay grade when the boss decides he‚Äôs done being the boss for the day. 

I tried to quit after being laid off from the end of March until Aug. He had expected me to continue working off the books at as close to full time as possible while collecting unemployment. I refused and he tried to post my position- but caved when he realized nobody was going to do my job for the rate I‚Äôm paid with no health insurance or other perks. So with reluctance I am still working for this POS - though on my terms. I clock my hours accordingly and am working remotely. 

In addition to my current job, I started up a medical billing and credentialing business with a friend while I was laid off. The idea was that I could get out of the current situation I‚Äôm in. So far it‚Äôs been tough getting traction - my business partner has a full time job still and is currently trying to replan her wedding that was supposed to take place early next year - thanks CoVid. We have had a few inquiries but nothing super solid. I know in this industry that this time of year isn‚Äôt the best to gain new business but I‚Äôm so tired of the current job that I‚Äôm desperate to get out. 

I know there‚Äôs always the idea of just quitting and hoping to get more time invested into my new business venture - I‚Äôm just having a hard time letting go because it‚Äôs guaranteed income during times that are anything but certain. And with my oldest kid remote learning I won‚Äôt necessarily have an option to do the same job I do now, much less remotely for someone else. The medical billing jobs around here are scarce. 

My husband works outside the home from 9-5 and does what he can to help but of course the bulk of the work falls on me. I think part of that is my inability to ask for help - I‚Äôve had to do things for myself by myself for a long time. What he does help with is great, but I still feel overwhelmed. And frankly I feel guilty asking for more help - almost like it‚Äôs my responsibility so I need to just get it done.  My husband says I need to find ways to relax but these days it‚Äôs getting harder to do. I have essential oils to help me sleep and stay calm. I‚Äôve tried different types of marijuana but I end up over thinking things and having an anxiety attack. 

So really I just find myself stuck. It‚Äôs 8 days until Christmas. I can‚Äôt just go out and have a day to myself and therapy of any kind is out of the question since I have no insurance. As it is, I have to have a tooth removed Monday because I can‚Äôt afford the root canal and it‚Äôs causing me additional pain and stress. 

I‚Äôm really just at a loss of what to do now or where to go from here. All I can ask to anyone who manages to read this entire post to please be kind. I still don‚Äôt know even as I type this whether or not I will post it. I just needed someone to hear me.

So to anyone who made it this far, thanks. I‚Äôve been a part of this sub for a while now and on the whole everyone here is very supportive. Probably why I even considered putting myself out here at all to be honest. So yeah I guess that‚Äôs it. Thanks for taking the time to see this post through."

It went TERRIBLY. He wound up saying he thought I might have borderline personality disorder, based on the fact that I had body dysmorphia ten years ago (even though I don't anymore..) Then he showed me the list of symptoms for borderline. Like the socially anxious, people-pleasing idiot I am, I wound up agreeing with some of the items on the list, because I didn't want to flout his medical opinion. Now I'm kicking myself, because I DON'T have an unstable identity, I DON'T ""split,"" and I'm one of the LEAST impulsive people I know (I overthink everything to the point of inaction!) But at the time I was like, ""Well, I guess if you think of it like THIS, then...""

Idk, I know he was just doing his job and meant well. Ever since going though, I'm super freaked out. He agreed not to write down his medical opinion on the report, but he did write down that he suggested DBT. Now I'm all worried that medical professionals are going to see the recommendation for DBT and think I have borderline, which is so (unfairly) stigmatized, and treat me badly.

Anyone else have bad appointments with psychiatrists? Feeling so worried right now. I can't stop going over it in my head and kicking myself for what I said, or thinking about my next appointment and what I'll do. My anxiety is worse than when I went in.

tl;dr: Went into appointment with psychiatrist, people-pleased my way into agreeing with a diagnosis that doesn't fit, feeling anxious and afraid that I won't get the help I need and will be stigmatized instead."

The student is in my mind a very promising young scientist but I have the impression that his mental health problems are getting the better of him and I would really like him to feel more at ease to reach his full potential but I   don't really know how to properly support him.

The field I am working in is quite competitive and to reach a high standard, people have to learn a lot in short amount of time. The work is challenging and I kind of depend on my students to tell me, when they need more assistence. However, this student is obviously very afraid to admit mistakes, which leads to him trying to build a wall around himself instead of asking for help when he needs it. I tried to tell him that it is ok, if there is something he doesn't know and that he should communicate problems he is experiencing, but he doesn't. He seems to be overthinking things a lot and tries to solve all problems on his own and hide it if he can't. In this manner, he is wasting a lot of time and seems to be overwhelmed by the workload. I am pretty certain he has the ability to keep up, but the anxiety is getting in his way. He has a lot of trouble with the public presentation of his work, spending weekends in the office, trying to make a perfect presentation but then stumbling trough it because he is so uncertain of himself. I got him to open up little in the past months and while we working together very closely it got better but now I switched to a different department and can not supervise him as closely. 

I tried to talk openly with him and told him that he needs to communicate about what is going on but he has stopped to do so and I feel that this will lead to more mistakes and then more anxiety about the mistakes and more hiding away. So my question would be, how do I break this downward spiral? How can I instill more confidence in him?

Ive recently come to understand the very odd nature of my anxiety and existential OCD induced thoughts.

It makes me feel crazy to look back and think of the things I believed, answers I thought I had to find, obsessions with spirituality and finding answers I developed. I can't believe I spent such a big part of my life anxiously analysing and going down every single rabbit hole- with absolutely no clue what I was even looking for. It makes me feel insane and like an idiot- I don't understand how I even came to think or believe those things.

After spiralling out yesterday and the day prior, I was managing alright today until I started obsessing again. And today at least I kind of figured out *why* I'm feeling anxious, but the *reason* for that anxiety is baffling me still. 


Out of nowhere, these last few days I've suddenly become *obsessed* with being perfect - as in what I eat, what I do, what I drink - and it's fuelling this downward spiral of self hatred and shame. I've convinced myself that my lifestyle choices are to blame for my mental health, even though that makes no sense.


I'm not an unhealthy person, I don't drink excessively or smoke, I cook my meals from scratch and don't eat takeout. But all of a sudden I'm getting caught up on not doing things right and feeling like I'm doing something *wrong*.  I had a glass of wine the other night and I keep guilt-tripping myself over it. I had a chocolate bar the other day and I've been making myself anxious with shame over it. 


I don't know why this is happening all of a sudden. I've never been too fussed about lifestyle choices before - I used to drink more when I was younger, I used to eat a lot unhealthier and I was *much* happier and calmer back then - but now it's like my brain is convinced that my mental health issues are caused by my lifestyle. 


Selfish as it sounds, I don't *want* to feel like the only way to be happy is to live like a monk. I enjoy the occasional bit of alcohol. I enjoy unhealthy food sometimes. Hell, my partner smokes weed and occasionally I like to join in, it helps me sleep and makes it easier to rationalize my anxieties.


But for some reason I can't stop obsessing and making myself feel sick with guilt over enjoying these things. I have had a physical health scare recently and am waiting for surgery to remove the offending organ, so do you think that's what set it off? Does anyone else suffer similar? How do I stop obsessing over being perfect in every aspect of my lifestyle?

Thought it would be good to update/get my experience out there.

Over the last couple of weeks I have felt bad anxiety over my fears of schizophrenia. Over the past 2 days I have felt slightly better although now and then I over analyse something that maybe happens in a tv show or something that someone does around me or just a horrible schiz ocd thought enters my mind. So last night I was in my bed watching cable guy (great film) and it‚Äôs the part in the toilets when he attacks Owen Wilson and then it came up on the tv about a description of the man they were looking for (Jim Carey) and I got a horrible rush of anxiety and the what if thought of ‚Äúwhat if they are actually looking for him just now‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs me they were talking about in that film‚Äù absolutely horrible anxiety that rushed through my body at this time. I jumped up out of bed and done mental compulsions saying ‚Äú I know for a fact no one is out to get me‚Äù ‚Äú no one is on their way to arrest me‚Äù this lasted I‚Äôd say for about 2 minutes and I lay in bed feeling the shaky and anxious way. The mental compulsions seemed to have worked but as I was trying to get to sleep they were still in my head and I was more scared of having that thought again. My issue is I cannot get away from looking up the symptoms of schizophrenia or losing my mind and believing these thoughts. Now my question is can looking up experiences and stories of others make OCD latch onto the fears? I feel like everything I‚Äôm thinking of now I‚Äôm catastrophising the whole ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù then I‚Äôm going online to see if anyone else has had these feelings and it causes me immense anxiety for I‚Äôd say sometimes upto 20/30 mins until I do some mental compulsions or hit google to get some sort of clarification. This has lasted about 2 weeks now and I get myself into such a panic I get quite emotional to my family and apologise for feeling this way. I have a call with a counsellor on Tuesday next week to go over the way I‚Äôm feeling and how to calm it down. My GP said it sounds an awful lot like health anxiety but with all the doubt in my mind I wonder if he‚Äôs just saying this and I feel like I want a diagnosis just so it gives me relief. This has been my obsession for the past couple of years and honestly I feel his time I just can‚Äôt shake it and it makes me worried and sad and I don‚Äôt like being scared and worried and anxious around my family because they are so loving and I just want to be better and back to my old self again.

So I'm an overthinker. I always have been. Thinhs that don't warrant anxiety are thought about over and over. Words I could have picked better. Faces I should or shouldn't have made. ""Why did I say that?"" ""They probably think that you're rude now.. they definitely think there's something wrong from you."" ""They're right to keep their distance."" It's overwhelming to say the least.

I was emotionally abused for a period of 10 years. Treated as though I was nothing and everything I said or did was wrong/incorrect/unkind etc. Made to feel like I couldn't make my own decisions without making the wrong choice. Taught to always walk on eggshells and be extremely careful with words. I was taught to live in fear.... And so now I do. 

I'm constantly panicking that I'm doing or saying something to offend someone even if I know I haven't. Even if all logic says otherwise. I still believe deep down that I've done something to offend someone and they punish me by not speaking to me (this being the punishment I was often given by my ex husband). These thoughts and feelings are a constant occurrence for me. And because it's happened so often, I tend to wonder if I'm actually making it up in my head or maybe I just am a horrible person. 

I don't want to think this way about myself. I want to stop overthinking every tiny decision I make. I want to be confident with who I am. But how do I do that?

I get easily attached to people because of my personality and my empathy. Every time I meet someone new in any context I'm socially awkward and if someone is nice to me and I feel like we could be friends then I overthink it and truly believe people dislike me or think I'm too much. Trying to hard. Or whatever else.

I am ALWAYS on edge waiting for the other show to drop.

Do you have any tips for me to help my anxiety when it comes to this kind of overthinking? It would be so kindly appreciated.

Hi all, just to give a bit of a background, this is my first time taking anti-anxiety meds, so I'm just curious if anyone else has had this reaction. Went to my doctor at the end of October after dealing with a lot of anxiety attacks that turned into a full blown daily health anxiety issue. Was prescribed 5 mg of Buspar daily. I ended up taking it on and off for awhile since I got scared of getting dependent on it before finally deciding to take the plunge to take it as prescribed. I've been taking it for a solid week now and my anxiety has leveled off somewhat. It's a lot easier to not pay attention to my racing thoughts and the heart palpitations that I was having daily disappeared. I feel a lot calmer and not as obsessed about my health as before. 

However, I've noticed that the past couple days, my jaw has been feeling tense/tired. It's like I've talked for too long and my muscles are tired. I know I've only been taking it for a week, that Buspar takes at least 2 weeks to really kick in, and that it takes awhile for the side effects to either lessen or disappear. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this before and if the effects disappeared (and if they did, how long did it take?). I've really been digging the calm that I'm getting from this med and worried about getting off it."

In March of this year I had my first battle with a brutal anxiety episode, not a surprising outcome considering the state of the world. It's been constant uphills and downhills until about August, when I had my first full-blown panic attack at work and I realized that this wasn't a passing thing. In the past couple months I've settled into a seemingly healthy lifestyle at home and my thoughts of fighting down waves of anxiety diminished. This week though, I've noticed that I consistently experience episodes of derealization during my pre-work routine as well as work itself. I can't always say I feel sickening clench of anxiety when I come into work but pretty much constantly there's been a subtle level of derealization. Today though, on my walk into work, I felt almost completely disconnected from my surroundings and felt incapable of interacting with the physical world in any capacity. It's settled down a bit, but I'm beginning to feel like I'm being unconsciously triggered in some way every single day by my surroundings. 

My question is, has anyone experienced triggering in the physical places you've had particularly bad panic attacks? Any tips or guidance for this, besides just straight up quitting my job? Thanks."
1694,upsidedownwaffles,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1608219122,"Procrastinating urgent tasks due to anxiety Hi everyone,

This is my first post. I'm someone who has struggled with anxiety and procrastination for awhile. I have been putting off asking professors for recommendation letters for grad school because I'm so anxious about thinking about it. I work full time and am taking pre reqs so there is a lot on my plate but I could have asked a month ago... Literally the only barrier was my emotions about asking and fear they would say no. I made good grades... Everyone would have said yes. Now only one has said yes and one can't due to being overworked and already busy with other letters. I can only hope others will say yes with limited time to write a letter. Why do I sabotage myself like this all the time? Maybe there is another sub to post this on? Sorry if it doesn't apply here. Just needed to vent and ask -- what do you do to get yourself to face your fears? Even when the desire to go to grad school should outweigh the fear, I chose to ignore and push away my feelings and wait until I knew I could literally wait no longer, until the fear of embarrassment if having to explain to my friends why I didn't get in to any schools outweighed the fear of asking. This is a vicious cycle I never want to repeat. I have a constant fluttering feeling in my throat while I scramble to ask ppl last minute and this week has been an emotional rollercoaster. I'm glad i finally asked for help but i need to get over fear of rejection."
1695,Kiteenpurrr_91,Family/Relationship,32,Anxiety,1608218515,"I've found the key to stop overthinking it. I've been with a bad boyfriend about a year ago and he definitely left a trauma in me.
Now currently I'm dating my current partner and he is everything I've wished for. However those memories and experience in the past come creeping up on me and caused me such a big mental breakdown the other day that I thought I couldn't get over it.
But to my surprise, this time I'm able to get pass my fear and worries and slowly coming back to who I was before. Although it's not completely, I would say that this time it is such a huge improvement from the last time.

The first thing I would say is to be self-aware of your train of thought. Try putting on a song and singing to the lyrics of it. You'll be surprised to find out how many times your mind automatically shift to other things and over think in just the chorus. I would say mine is 5 times. After that you can learn how to be focus on what you're doing in the moment. Train your brain. After a day of doing it the brain will pick up the habit and recreate it the next day.

The second thing I learn is accepting there is uncertainty in all around us. I've sweat all over the place with just the thought of having to meet my partner because I don't know what to do, what to say, how should I react when we're actually talking. By being afraid too much, my brain will start over analyzing for sign that I'm OK to reassure myself. HOWEVER, that is only a momentary cure for a long time battle.
The key is to focus focus focus and accepting there's nothing you can do about the unknown. Living in the moment is what you should care for. Don't try to imagine a life in 1 year time, 5 year, 10 year because you never know what will happen.

In conclusion, although I'm not 100% coming back to my old cheerful self, I'm still able to function and laugh and love with just a little issue that hopefully in a few days coming I might be able to resolve. And I hope if you're going through the same thing as me, you can learn a few things from it and I will send my biggest encouragement to you because I know how hard can it be to recover from a anxiety attack since folks who have not experienced it will never know.

A lot of love for you. We will get through it together."

1699,Bubbly-Peanut4679,Work/School,5,Anxiety,1608216502,"Getting in trouble at work, how to deal with the dread? Hey all, throwaway for fun reasons. 

I messed up at work and didn't answer a client for almost two weeks over something very small/easy. They kept following up with me but I don't know why, I just did other tasks instead. 

Obviously a huge mess up. They reached out to my boss complaining, he reached out to me. I explained that I messed up/it was on me, I didn't manage my time right and that I would apologize directly to the client and it wouldn't happen again. I didn't exactly tell him how long it had been because I was ashamed and scared of his response :-(. 

He didn't respond, I reached out to him directly and apologized to him (boss), said that I am trying to manage my workload, work on new projects, and deal with personal issues (I just lost my grandma last month - we were very close and it's my first death in a long time. I have depression &amp; anxiety, it's been tough). 

He replied to that saying no problem, everyone is human and that he would call the client tomorrow. Major heart attack to me. So I fessed up and said that I hadn't gotten back to the client in a long time and that it's not in my character to do so, that it was a stupid, 1st level thing to not take care of. Basically what I know he will say to me after he speaks to that client. 

The thing is I am terrified of my boss. We get along normally but he can be really scary/overbearing when he gets mad. I get overwhelmed and he will just get more and more angry. I did mess up here, but I know he will really, really rub my nose in it and say he can't trust me now or something to that effect. 

My workload is overwhelming, many nights I work so many extra hours for no additional pay and I can't even keep up. Any complaints about this go unheard and in fact, can hurt you because he won't think you're a ""team player"" or word hard, and that he works so many hours and hours and doesn't eat or sleep. 

He didn't reply to my last message and it's just eating me up. I felt dread all last night and all day today. I can't focus. I know I messed up, I know I will be reprimanded and I deserve it but how can I deal with this dread? I tell myself it's just going to happen and pass, but inside I feel like all my blood is rushing around. I'm just so mad I am getting in trouble for something so small/dumb. I don't know why I did that.  

Inside I do think what I did was wrong, and stupid, but I don't think it is the worst thing I could've done. Why do I feel dread like the world is going to end? Big whoop if I get yelled at, but my body is telling a different story. I feel as much dread/weird feelings as if I did something much, much worse.

Q. In the process of looking for ""self-help ideas"" for anxiety related issues, I became familiar with other things that surround this disorder. From others' posts here, I can formulate what things people with such illnesses experience. So if I visit a therapist, would he/she be skeptical that I might be faking the info just to get a prescription and am just looking for a reason to blame for all my failures?

Tbh he/she might even be right, maybe I am looking for something to blame for my own shortcomings.

My sister paces a lot. I love her to death, but it makes me want to curl up in a ball and die.

It‚Äôs so grating to me that I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep because of it.

This is a bit of a long one, but here goes.  I've (f26) had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but over the last five years it's gotten worse. About 6 months ago, it became absolutely brutal and I was struggling. I had a new, stressful job and was getting to the end of my rope. 

About 2 months ago, I started therapy and medication. I've only had a couple sessions with a therapist which has helped a little, but I also started an ssri, celexa. At first I wasn't sure it was working, but after about 6 weeks I started noticing changes. I haven't finished a full meal in years but now I only occasionally have leftovers. I now have 3 meals a day instead of 2 very small meals. My libido has also gone waaay up. I've had better s*x over the last 2 weeks than over the last five years. Even better, my anxiety has decreased a lot. I still have anxious episodes, but much less frequent and less severe than before.

I am incredibly reluctant to take medications because I am always afraid I‚Äôm going to have an allergic reaction.

I started dating Bo when I was 20 he was 29. I always thought we connected well we both had a dark sense of humor and love for film. He worked a decent job but over his life had bouts of depression where he has significant gaps in his resume. He didn't finish university because even though he went to a phenomenal university, he said the classes didn‚Äôt interest or challenge him enough.




I work and go to school part-time at a university in the Los Angeles area. About six months into our relationship, he quit his job because he said they were not letting him progress. He had to move home to Denver in with his parents because he couldn't afford rent. I was devastated and hurt because I tried to talk to him about options for a new job, but he was stubborn and refused. I bring up how much it hurt he left he says he doesn't feel bad he did nothing wrong



He has been home for a year and a half not working because he says his depression is so severe. When he moved back, he tried to talk to me about suicide. I said I'm not a professional I love you, but you need to speak to a doctor I can't handle that. He brings up consistently how I abounded him in his time of need. He had gone to a residential treatment place before but left because he thought they were ripping him off and that their advice was terrible. I stopped dating him officially after he moved but still talked to him.



He would say that I'm a liar. He would always try to catch me in lies like ask me aggressively if I've taken my sleeping meds (I'm proscribed this) I feel awkward to put on the spot so I say no then he goes and counts my pills. If I send him a photo, he's checked the metadata to see if I'm lying and if I don't say the exact date he calls me a liar.



He says I lie more than anyone he knows. He brings up the time I drank some of my roommate's juice or smoked one of her cigs and said I didn't. We will be texting every day frequently. He‚Äôll ignore me for days saying he can't talk because of the depression I get upset and try to text him.



He says I'm entitled and I'm not allowed to someone's attention that I need to learn boundaries. He would bring up regularly how he misses perks from his old job. If I ever criticized him or lost my temper with him he would say I‚Äôm the meanest person he‚Äôs ever met. When I bring up the mean stuff he‚Äôs said about me he says ‚Äúeverything I say about you is objective fact with evidence behind it everything you say is a petty insult‚Äù



I would say to him he quit that job for no reason he could quickly get it back or live with that choice. He says I'm mean because I never let him vent. He always tells me my memory is terrible and reminds me about lies in the past. When I try to bring up something from the past, he says,‚Äù I trust my memory MORE THAN YOURS.‚Äù When I lost my temper he‚Äôs sent screenshots of the texts to mutual friends making me look bad. I would never send private texts to a mutual friend.



His plans are nothing at this point he says he's just there that he isn't going to kill himself but too depressed to work. I stopped talking to him because of other reasons, but I can't stop shaking the feeling. Do I come off as a liar? Do I sound like a bad liar?

Like, I used to work at a nature center teaching kids, I've also worked at a nature summer camp, and even lived in a tent for 2 summers while working at camp, and I've loved all of it. I actually love camping and hiking and things like that (except I don't really like anything to do with heights or fast-paced/stressful things). 

But I've hardly gone outside in months. I'll go for a short hike or walk once in a while, but I mostly spend so much time at home being a hermit. Is this pandemic-related? Or just my anxiety acting up? I just feel like, wtf? Why am I not doing things that I know will probably make me feel good?

I think maybe part of it is I truly just don't like seeing other people at the trails...is that weird? Or maybe I don't like going alone? Also I live in rural area so going for walks on the roads doesn't feel super safe (fast cars, no sidewalks). And going to the trail means driving, which gives me anxiety. But still, I would think that I would be able to overcome these if it really felt worth the perceived risks.

Going into this I liked reading poetry but had never tried my hand at writing any. Well, part of this class is writing our own poetry and sharing one with the class as part of an anonymous critque. I'm definitely not an overly sensitive person but I was nervous going in because as it turns out, I'm not very good at writing poetry but I gave it my best and turned in something I was happy with.

Everyone else was getting good feedback on theirs but looking at the 3 comments on mine (so far, it's not ""due"" for other people yet) my classmates are confused. I'm so embarrassed, I thought the symbolism was *too* clear but all the comments are about how they don't understand it. I'm not upset with them but myself. I'm so embarrassed.

I'm dreading hearing everyone else's comments especially the professor and I just want the critique to be over but I still have 25+ comments to go.

Again, I'm not upset with them, this is what they're supposed to do and I can fix it afterward for midterm but I feel so awful and out-of-place.

My doctor prescribed 20mg if Viibryd, but after reading up on it I'm pretty terrified to take it. Brain fog, decreased short term memory, brain zaps, loss of libido, nausea, sleep paralysis. I already have extremely vivid and sometimes lucid dreams so I assume there is a strong chance I may get sleep paralysis from it. I can deal with those in the short term while I adjust, *but* I'm specifically nervous about PSSD and any other long-term effects (especially because PSSD can happen even if you stop taking it after only a few doses. In fact it blows my mind that no doctor has ever mentioned that to me...)

I tried Zoloft earlier this year and reacted horribly to it. I had intense brain fog, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, the whole nine yards. I couldn't even tell if it made my anxiety any better or worse because I was so frustrated with how shitty I felt during the day. 

I'm strongly leaning away from trying Viibryd because of the side effects. If I do take it, I would cut the 20mg pill in half and try only 10mg. But even so...I don't think I want to risk tampering with my brain. I'm a teacher/researcher and I really depend on my cognitive abilities for my income and livelihood. I also have ADHD, which I've just finally gotten somewhat under control with medication (Concerta 18mg).  

I'm 27 and I've had extreme anxiety since childhood. Clonazepam helps when I need it...but I'm not willing to take a Benzo every day, I don't think my doc would even give me a prescription for that frequency even if I wanted it. It's just frustrating because ***I feel like I'm probably doomed to live at a baseline of ""somewhat panicked"" for the rest of my life.*** SSRI's have so many cons and I'm sensitive to medication. Mindfulness and exercise all those things help but ya know (I'm probably preaching to the choir here) it can only help so much...

Does anyone have advice or experience with Viibryd? I'm at a loss here.

So this is my somewhat selfish attempt to make myself listen and believe this, I hope they might be of some comfort to someone else:

* You are safe. 
* You are stronger than you think, the fact that you've made it this far is proof of that strength, others might have crumbled, but you've held on. 
* These feelings and thoughts will eventually pass, just as they have before.  
* You are not defined by your anxiety, so do not devalue yourself.
* There is still hope and happiness in the world.
* Though others might think our worries are silly or unwarranted, they are real to us so don't compare yourself to others.
* Though anxiety feels overwhelming when you're in the middle of it, it won't always be in the driver's seat of your life, even if you have to fake it until you make it.

It sounds like a good trait to have, but before I left this job I felt like every day was blurry and I never had time for myself. It took heavy tolls on me and my relationships but I still feel the need to fill my schedule, maybe it‚Äôs because everyone has come to think of me as super successful and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone idk. 

Does anyone have any tips?"

I have a friend who I have only known for maybe a week? A week an a half? They're a lot of fun but they're also a MASSIVE flirt, it is literally how they communicate. I enjoy their company. However, I am very uncomfortable with flirting and romance, but I kind of try to reciprocate to be fun and nice. I just want to be a good friend. However, something they said today kind of made me feel a bit uncomfortable, as it straddled the line between... are they flirting and trying to be cute, or are they actually interested? And I'm not interested, but I also don't want to be mean, and I don't know if they're joking or serious, or... 

And I feel horrible. I feel so stressed, my chest is aching and I feel like panicking, or crying, it's completely irrational. This past week has been very similar, and it's horrible. These little mini-scenarios that other people would take in their stride are coming along and freaking me out. I feel so anxious and stressed, and I'm not sure how I can be productive (I'm studying, although my deadlines are a long way away) while also reacting so poorly to stress and anxiety. I think it is all adding up, as well? I mean I've had at least four days of constant mini-crisis and they're starting to affect me. Today it was being stressed about the flirting, whereas yesterday it was over something completely unrelated. But the feeling of panic and pressure and tension is the same, it's awful and I don't know what to do."

This is much more acute if that person is someone I am pursuing romantically. The truth is that many people (especially from dating apps) flake and stop responding so every time someone takes longer than I'd expect to respond to me, I start wondering if I need to begin accepting that I have been ghosted once again. 

The biggest issue with this type of anxiety is that it turns my phone into a sort of psychic weapon. Whether I check it or intentionally don't check it, I feel that it is always in response to the concern about when or if this response will arrive. 

Do you experience anything similar? If so, have you found any good ways to deal with it? Keeping in mind that rational thoughts (i.e. ""maybe they are just busy"") don't always work to calm anxiety (which is generally irrational)."

1782,Ok-Marionberry890,Advice Needed,4,Anxiety,1615936442,"does going out of your comfort zone actually work? Right now, I'm a high school senior deciding between two colleges. The only thing that's holding me back is my anxiety. One is a big school in an out-of-state big city with 30k students.

The other is a small school that's 45 mins away with 7k students (3k more than my high school). That campus already feels like home, but I feel like maybe I should go out of my comfort zone?

The thing is, is that going out of my comfort zone doesn't always work. For example, i joined this debate club Freshman year. Yeah, I bettered my publc speaking, and everything was going fine. But then literally out of the blue (literally so random) my junior year I started getting panic attacks when public speaking. I couldn't stand, I got heart palpitations, couldn't drink coffee anymore. The more I got out of my comfort zone, the worse that it got.

Then on the other hand, one time I went on this school trip that was a week away from home. For the first time in years I made new friends, went to my first ever (and only) party. Got reallllll out of my comfort zone and it was great. Had 0 anxiety for the first time in forever.

So I'm conflicted on whether getting out of your comfort zone actually works. Do I cower in the comfort of living close to home? Do I combat my anxiety (that makes me physically nauseous; seriously thinking about this is making me sick) by going to a big school?

I don't know."

Don't receive things as a personal attack but receive them with love.

Don't give things with any other intent other than a love for people.

The other main problem I get is nausea when I try to eat food sometimes, it is like I have to force myself to eat. When my anxiety kicks in I constantly think about my stomach as if I have a digestive issue which I don‚Äôt as I‚Äôve seen a GI doc and he has ran many tests that ruled out most digestive issues but not that ones that go undetected like IBS for example... not saying I have it. I am curious to see if any of you guys are or were in the same boat and was able to get your appetite back and enjoy eating food again and if so how you overcame the anxiety or whatever you had. Also how long have you guys ever been without eating any food at all? I am 19 years old and hate that I have to go through this right now as I have no reason for the cause of my anxiety it just came out of nowhere.

In the past week or so I've been having feelings of extreme terror and hopelessness. I've had panic attacks all of my life, these are worse. I can't describe it but they feel so dark. I can't describe it, but they feel like absolute imminent danger. These feelings tend to linger throughout the day, at some points building up to absolute unbearable levels. I've barely been eating or sleeping. I have no idea why these are happening, My mind keeps getting filled with 'dark' images, not necessarily straight up disturbing, but ones that sort of imply something disturbing, like a dilapidated building at night. Once an attack passes, I can conjure up the feelings again by remembering these images or feelings, and it's been trapping me in a really bad loop where I can be feeling fine but remember these feelings and then start to feel them again and freak out. That's been my entire week, basically. I don't know why this started. I had two similar episodes back in the spring.

The only trigger I can think of is that I watched a disturbing true crime type documentary on Netflix a few days before this really came to a head. That night I couldn't sleep basically at all. But I haven't really ever had something like that effect me in such a way before.

This is so fucking hard because I keep remembering this feeling and then all of the sudden I'm feeling it all over again. Even when I'm not dwelling on it, something will remind me of the images or anything of that feeling and then I'm back in the hole. This is so fucking horrifying because I can not feel safe. Even when I'm at home with my family, I still get that feeling again. I just can't seem to escape it right now. It's so disturbing and uncomfortable.

I'm trying to tell myself that this is just anxiety but it so fucking horrible, this is so severe to even other panic attacks I've had, and this has been going on for days. I'm entering a partial hospitalization program on Monday, and my psychiatrist prescribed me Ativan but I'm too afraid to take it because I don't want to get addicted, although it might come time when I have to take it. However, that only provides 4 or so hours of relief in a day, and I don't want to be taking it constantly or else I definitely will get addicted. So basically if I take some right now then that means I can't take any for the next few days in order to be safe.

What is going on here? What do I do? How do I stop remembering the horrible feeling constantly? Every time I seem to feel better I remember the feeling so now I've been trapped in this feeling for like a week now. I just haven't been able to escape to cycle. Please offer some help."

TL;DR: I had a panic attack at Walmart and feel very anxious and embarrassed. 

For me shopping at large stores like Walmart and Target are sensory hell. It starts when I walk in the door and there are too many people coming and going and always one random person inexplicably standing right in the middle of the path to the doors in such a way it is difficult to get around them. Then there is the music, the loud music that is random genres so you may here an old favorite right next to a modern pop song that makes you want to plug your ears.  Getting anything in the grocery section is the worst because it is always the most crowded. To unwind I try to go to the electronics area because there is rarely anyone there but the TV display is playing music loudly clashing with the store music.  When I finally go to check out there are long lines at almost every checkout, and people are NOT staying 6 feet apart from each other. Waiting in line I feel so trapped, like I can't leave if I need to because I have perishable stuff in my cart, but I can't go to another line because there are people behind me now and all the lines are long anyways. Today someone wanted to look at something on the shelf in the checkout line I was in but they just entered my 6 foot bubble without a word and I started to try to become one with a turned off conveyor belt, and then someone came in line behind me leaving like a foot between their cart and me and I just full panicked.  I started to cling to the cart, tightly wrapping my hands in the grate under the handle, I was breathing heavy and I just kept thinking I have to escape. Worst part is that whenever I have a bad panic attack it takes me a while to get over the embarrassment, because I'm sure I look crazy freaking out in public, and it brings up trauma from other times I've had bad panic attacks as my brain tries to determine the common trigger."

Frequent anxiety problems and panic attacks during my sleep which cause me to wake up and depression is what I am dealing with atm.

I just have a lot of problems focusing, and keeping my mind from drifting of into ""what if"" states. When my mind is drifting of, it usualy results in me having the fear of being alone forever. I mean that doesnt come out of nowhere to be fair. I am now 20 years old and have been in one relationship, which lasted 4 months, and didnt end like I thought it would. In addition I only made bad experiences with dating apps and got friendzoned a lot in highschool, which hurt a lot. That alone I could deal with and have been for 5 years now. But the other things that came on top now, just make it unbearble for me. The problem I have is, that I cant really can talk to my familiy about this, because my mom is hugely overprotective, which doesnt help at all.

Due to me still being university, moving out isnt really a thing I can to atm. I just dont know what to do atm and any help would be appreciated."

1857,MYGOLYGO,Helpful Tips!,3,Anxiety,1614461588,"I‚Äôm new around here, but I completely solved my own personal anxiety for years by reading just 1 article. Maybe it can help you. I‚Äôll sum it up but my anxiety took a major turn after I took a lot of drugs. HPPD/DP/DR what ever you want to call them over took me for years. Anxiety has been with me since I was 17 (if I look back I recognise anxiety as early as 7 years old) I am 29 now. 

The ONLY article that has ever ‚Äòcured‚Äô my anxiety was getting my head around this &gt; https://www.anxietycoach.com/claire-weekes.html 

This is not a coping strategy nor a cure there is no cure. Anxiety is normal. But we react in an exaggerated way in the face of danger. In my case I was fearing fear. You can snowball that as well. So fearing fear is basically the definition of an anxiety disorder. You become scared of having anxiety. I did any way, for fear of detachment and other bad symptoms etc. 

This article is quite heavy on metaphors but if you can understand it...honestly that is your Holy Grail.

BTW it took months of continuous practise and discipline in the face of fear to solve this. I still slip up now, sometimes, but immediately go back to this way of living. 

Hope it helps."

1859,emobe_,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1614460999,"Feels like I'm back to square one I'm 26, always had some sort of anxiety but it was minor and managed to deal with it, considered myself ""shy"". Had a depressive spout around high school though I coped with that through skateboarding and eventually leaving high school and getting into my dream career.

However about 5 years ago, from the result of a toxic job, I ended up having severe panic attacks and could not function through the day due to the anxiety and I eventually ended up being put on 25mg of sertraline which I then went up to 50mg. 

After about a year, along with CBT, mindfulness, yoga and forcing myself to eat better, things were much better. Sure the anxiety was still around but I could function and get on with daily life.

I was a freelance web developer for a long time and I ended up working from my bedroom as my house does not have enough space and I am an avid PC gamer, so I pretty much ended up sleeping, working and hanging out in the same room. 

Following the toxic job, I decided I wanted to stop freelance and get a full time job in an office. Thankfully web development jobs aren't in your typical cubical offices and are generally good environments. However lockdown here in the UK ended that of course so I am back to working from home again.

In September, I decided I wanted to come off the meds so I weened off of them with help of the doctor. However over the months after coming off, I noticed I was feeling much more anxious again but I was ignoring it and telling myself I can handle this. Turns out I couldn't.

I'm back to not wanting to get out of bed, struggling to do basic things such as shower without feeling like having a panic attack.

I did not keep up with everything I learnt from CBT and mindfulness. I instead took it for granted and now I feel like I did 5 years ago. Lockdown for sure hasn't helped either.

Now I'm trying to get back onto meds, I tried for 3 days and could not handle the side affects this time.  I have been prescribed 50mg again and I have been taking half a tablet.. I'm wondering if I should go down to 25mg and take half of that at first instead.

I'm full of high anxiety almost all day now, with brief pauses when I'm distracted. I feel very spaced out and my brain races and silly little things send me in a spiral. Thoughts such as ""this feels like a dream"" or ""is any of this real?"" come to mind which usually set me off. 

I know that it is NOT a dream and its all real. It's like my brain is intentionally trying to scare me when i'm anxious. The anxiety seems to make me feel very spaced out and of course it just causes a cycle. Usually this starts from the second I wake up, I remember this happening 5 years ago and hadn't happened since. I feel **this** is what is hindering me the most right now.

When anxiety is high, my eyes feel very heavy, everything seems ""too bright"" and I have to close my eyes. I also get a very heavy head, like I have to keep my head down, like a literal weight on my shoulders. It's almost like being stoned but in a really bad way.

I did smoke weed almost every day from when I was around 18 until about christmas last year when I started feeling anxious again. I did take about a years break 5 years ago when the anxiety stared as it does not help at all for my anxiety. Though through that I started taking CBD products which I felt helped with calming myself. 

So I have a couple of questions - 

*  Does anyone feel similar thoughts/feelings mentioned above that set them off? Spaced out, things feeling like a dream etc.
*  Should I go down to 25mg in order for the side affects to be less? (I will consult the doctor too, I would just like an opinion too)
*  What things do you do to help relieve the anxiety and sense of dread? Mindfullness/breathing used to be my go to solution but I have lost touch with that and need to get back into it. Curious to see what others do to help."
1860,Drek_drek4428, ,0,Anxiety,1614460818,"Close to 50 and realizing I don‚Äôt have the tools to deal with anxiety I know I have anxiety. Social definitely. But what is creeping back into my mind is making it hard to function and enjoy everyday life. I recently got promoted to a supervisor role, 3 months ago, and I am doing a great job. I have been told this by management. However the anxiety that has come with this promotion is constantly telling me that I messed up somehow, that I‚Äôm not good enough, that I said the wrong thing to the wrong person etc etc and a million other etcs. My brain is attacking itself and it‚Äôs running me into the ground. I have this nervous ball that sits behind my chest constantly, I lack energy to do things outside of work because I‚Äôm using so much energy trying to appear normal at work. My GI track is a mess and sleep only comes if I take an edible to knock me out. I know that this is causing a strain on my relationship.
        I used to run a small company and I had anxiety then but I  also heavily used alcohol. I had thought that my anxiety then was due to my drinking. 20 years later I had to leave the company and go into rehab because the anxiety and raging alcoholism nearly killed me. This was 8 years ago and I had to start anew. I spent time building myself back and am proud of what I have accomplished. That was until this new step in my career. 
         So I know I have social anxiety and have spent the last 8 years avoiding as many functions/parties as I can. I can‚Äôt avoid work and now after writing that I know avoidance is not the healthiest way to deal with it. So here I am and I don‚Äôt have the tools to continue where I am. So what am I going to do? I am going to step back from my promotion, seek therapy and try to fill up my toolbox with all the tools I can use. I may decide that management is just not for me and I‚Äôm going to have to be ok with that. I am going to have to be ok with success in life outside of work and maybe my ego will allow me to work without lofty career goals. It is ok to be where I am, right? It is ok to be who I am, right? Rhetorical 
          Maybe what I need to do is focus on now and let the future become the present without a thought to it. What I know is that I feel better just putting this out there. Out of my brain and into the air for just a minute is a breath I needed."

I don't have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, but I feel like I do have one deep down. Anxiety didn't used to be a problem for me, which is odd because I grew up in an abusive environment; it only came up at first a few months after I was sexually harassed. Every time I don't understand something I break down and punish myself for something I've been trying to learn for 2 days. I'm so used to being decent at things and I think this is hurting me a lot. Everytime I'm put into a situation where there are more than 2-3 other people I'm talking to, I get really nervous and start to cry so I have to back out and do something by myself for a little while. I also get bad anxiety just randomly when something reminds me of a bad memory or just makes me uncomfortable and I have to again step away and calm myself down. I also have the same problem when someone gets really mad at me like I'm a child, and I end up bawling. I was raised to where if something broke and I was the last one who used it or it was my possession, it was always my fault no matter if I did it or not. My family members don't believe me when I point out these things that aren't normal for most people. I'm really afraid to bring it up to a medical professional whenever I get normal yearly check-ups and I find a really hard time to calm down unless I listen to a bunch of music or someone patient and I'm comfortable with is with me and willing to help me calm down. 

What should I do? I've been fighting this and depression for so long and I'm tired of feeling this way but I'm also scared of taking meds or getting medical treatment."
1862,Jacobisbatman123,Advice Needed,3,Anxiety,1614459339,"I think my anxiety is causing me to dissociate/disconnect I‚Äôm 21. I have suffered from anxiety my whole life. My parents have said that since I was a little kid I was terrified of dying. That I would stay up all night not being able to sleep because of it

I suppressed this for a number of years. Until a couple of months after my 18th birthday when the realisation of my mortality and shortness of life hit me hard. 

Since then I have suffered from anxiety for many things. Since starting university I am constantly scared of my grades, failing, the consequences of me failing, my parents hating me, being alone, ending up homeless etc.

It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I have thoughts of harming myself sometimes (though I would only ever do it to try and escape and not because I want to die at all)

Recently I have felt so disconnected from reality all the time. Sometimes my anxiety just fades away and I am unable to bring myself to do stuff like my assignments

It‚Äôs like reality doesn‚Äôt feel real anymore. I‚Äôve lost all sense of who I am, what I want to do, what I need to do. I can‚Äôt physically bring myself to focus on everything around me

I always forget things. I forget to eat, I forget to brush my teeth even when I swear not to, I forget to take my medication and then feel anxious of if my doctor/parents find out

My dreams have become so vivid that most nights I feel as if its real. I wake up in the morning and am almost shocked that it wasn‚Äôt real.

I will set alarms and swear to get up at certain times and then in the morning I just won‚Äôt care and go back to sleep

I will hate myself for it later but in the moment I just didn‚Äôt care. Same with making plans to eat better. I‚Äôll buy apples and yoghurts to try be healthy and then they‚Äôll sit in the fridge for weeks because i just forget

I‚Äôll go to kfc for tea even though I swore not to, was scared what will happen because I‚Äôm wasting too much on it, but In the moment I just don‚Äôt care. My feelings of anxiety about it just disappear

Then 3 months later when I realise how much I‚Äôve wasted I‚Äôm suddenly terrified again

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this. The only emotion I ever feel is fear and sometimes even that leaves me and I just feel nothing 

I want to get therapy but my family is poor and can‚Äôt afford to send me and as a student I can‚Äôt afford it either

I‚Äôve asked so many times for referrals or signed up for counselling and been made to wait over half a year.

By then I reach brief moments of reprieve from my anxiety. But in these moments I just make mistakes again without noticing and lose the ability to care when I really should

I keep thinking I‚Äôve escaped my anxiety but in reality it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve just pushed all emotion away

I want some kind of diagnosis because I know it‚Äôs beyond just anxiety at this point. My brain just doesn‚Äôt work like other peoples. I‚Äôm sick of hating myself but something stops me from seeing my mistakes until it‚Äôs too late 

I need help but the health system just doesn‚Äôt care here. If I‚Äôm not actively trying to kill myself im not a priority. I‚Äôve even had thoughts now of harming just to get the attention from the doctors and be taken somewhere where I will be properly noticed"

Hello Guys, this may sound silly to some. But i have OCD and Tourette Syndrome. And i'm sometimes forced to do things that i don't even want to do at all. For example, as a kid i had the compulsive thought that i ""need to unlock my jaw"" by opening my mouth repeatedly as far as i could. I was terrified that someday i will able to be succesful, but it never happened.

My \*\*\*\*\* OCD brain kicked in, and since then i have the scary urge, to build pressure in my stomache/colon area... you know.. like when you are pooping. And i'm terrified that like something will snap from this and i just day instantly. This has to be my most scary intrusive thought. I had other self harming tics and stuff like that, like biting my lip open, but nothing seemed to be actually dangerous for me. But i feel like this time, it maybe really is. And i just can't make it stop. I usually deal pretty good with my OCD and my tics. But i just don't know what to do with this. Can anyone help me calm down, is this really dangerous for me, and if yes, has someone ANY idea how i can make this stop as soon as possible?

Thank you for reading :)

I was in second or third grade and we had a spelling test. (The bonus word on the test was Connecticut, not that it matters, it‚Äôs just a useless memory). 
My pencil broke literally writing my name on the test. Rather then get up and sharpen it in a quiet room of other people. I did the whole ass test with nothing but the tip of lead that broke off. It wasn‚Äôt until I handed it in that my teacher asked what the hell happened as i can only assume it looked like I had a stroke during the test. Either way, I still know how to spell Connecticut right, but I‚Äôll for sure not correct like, a waitress who screws up my order, because..life."

1889,cozaure,Needs A Hug/Support,2,Anxiety,1614451784,"I broke down for the 1st time since a few months I [22 F], have been struggling with anxiety since a long time. Two of my worst ""peak anxiety times"" have been this summer, and November/December. 

In November and December, I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, it was really really bad (even though I had virtual weekly 30 minutes long sessions with a psychologist from the university, she didn't help me much).

I'm very very afraid of the future in general. I'm currently doing the last year of my master's degree. Every time I think of the ""after"", I'm paralyzed and terrified and in a very bad mental space. My plan is to become a public servant (in France, public servants can't be fired, therefore it is a ""secure"" job, plus that's really what I like to do, working for the public interest). In order to do that, I'll have to pass an highly selective competitive exam.

I begun a 6-months-long internship in January, and it's going GREAT. I love it, and for 2 months, I haven't have any big anxiety crisis. I avoid thinking about the ""after"" and focus on the present, and really, I was proud of myself. I even dealt with very stressful situations at work, had to make phone calls/contact people (something I HATE), and for now I'm doing good. 

Everything was fine, until today, where my father asked me how my preparation for the competitive exam (in June) was going, and what were my options for preparation programs if I don't pass the exam in June. 

I was having a nice day, was enjoying my week end with my family... and instantly, thinking about ""the future"" and the ""after university"", of unplanned things, made me feel so so so bad. I felt the anxiety growing and growing and growing, and at some point I even had to go to my room where I cried, cried, cried. 

The idea of not passing the exam to be a public servant, of not being accepted in a preparation program, of not finding a job, of not being sure of what my life will look like in 8 months, in 1 year, the feeling of uncertainty, of not knowing what I'm going to do with my life... Thinking about every single thing that could go wrong, realizing how I can't control everything in my future... for something so important, it terrified me, made me feel awful, and I just broke down. 

Before I had to leave to cry in my room, I told my father I'd rather not think about it because it was making me feeling stressed and paralyzing, but he said that he could get that, but that I needed to make sure to be prepared, that I needed to think about it anyway, even if it was making me feel bad... 

I know he's right, and that denial isn't an option, but not thinking about this thing that is paralyzing me was the only way I found to cope. (Besides, I'm still studying a little for this exam in June, and I still keep in mind that in mid-March I'll have to apply for preparation programs... but until then, the less I think about it, the better I feel).

It makes me feel so frustrated because I really felt like I was doing so much better since January, I didn't have any big anxious episode like today in more than 2 months, and I find it very disappointing to see that the anxiety is still there, and to realize that anxiety crisis and break downs can still happen at any time, even when I thought everything was fine, even when I was having a good time and didn't expect it to happen. 

I didn't tell my parents I had to cry. I feel like they don't understand how anxious I am, how anxious I get, and why.

During the talk with my father, my mother just said ""even if you don't find a job right after graduating, that's fine, you'll just come back home with us until you find something. It's normal, no one find a job the week after they graduate, it's not the end of the world!""

I know that objectively, it's not the end of the world, that it's not rational to feel the way I feel, to react the way I react... But that's literally the definition of anxiety! Anxiety isn't rational! 

I feel that no one understands what I experience, why I react that way, in my family, among my friends, and it makes me feel very very alone.

I also feel very ashamed of reacting that way, therefore I don't tell it (or I hide how bad I really react, how bad I really feel) to my parents or to my friends, because I know it's not ""normal"" and that I shouldn't be so paralyzed and feel so bad about the future like that. 

Writing this post helped me to feel better, though. Writing down my thoughts always helped me. Posting it here on this sub, I hope that some of the readers will understand what I'm going through and that I'll feel less alone? Even if no one reads it and no one answers, at least it helped me to write it down. 

If anyone has some advices, or some similar experiences to share, or just have some supportive/comfort words, it would really help me, though. Thanks for reading, sorry for the lenght!"

I wasn't ashamed of a particular thing I said or did.

1895,DuchessDreamcatcher,Family/Relationship,0,Anxiety,1614450593,"Relationship Anxiety Hey! So basically I have been messaging this boy since Halloween and we have both liked eachother since September when we moved into Uni. He is one of a kind and is so caring, loving and understanding. In January we confessed that we both liked eachother and I was on Cloud Nine. For context, we both have been at home since November due to Covid and doing online Uni. One week I'm head over heels in love with him and the next I'm an anxious mess and I keep doubting my emotions. I want to enjoy the moment but I can't. The thought of hurting him and not being in a relationship with him makes me cry, feel anxious and emotionally drained. But the thought of being with him makes me anxious. I have been hurt so much in the past and I think I'm scared of spiralling again. I have talked to him about this and he said that it's best to go slow as he wants me to be comfortable. I am so scared of not feeling the same spark when I meet him again. 

I think I'm scared of a relationship. I have never been in a relationship before and I have never had someone who loves me this much before (apart from family). I keep telling myself that it will all be better when I meet him. But I'm scared and anxious that I won't feel in love anymore. He is like a best friend and more too me. Today I have really doubted my love for him. But this has happened before and a day later I was so in love again. I don't know whether I'm sad because he is so lovely or because I'm scared of hurting him. 

I know therapy is probably the best option but due to personal circumstances it is tricky to do so. I was wondering if any of you have had similar experiences and advice please. (This all happens when I get stressed about work but I want it to go away)

1915,nojox,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1627161893,"Checklist - Which of these behaviours have you been doing regularly? * Threatening yourself with harm
* Screaming at yourself to solve a problem
* Screaming at yourself to make a fear go away
* Scolding yourself because that's how you deserve to be treated
* Warning yourself of dire consequences
* Asking yourself the loaded question ""what if you do this again?""
* Asking yourself the loaded question ""what if this happens again?""
* Telling yourself that being scared means being safe
* Telling yourself that being alert 24x7 means being safe
* Demanding perfect safety immediately and always
* Judging yourself by arbitrary social standards picked up from school, college or family
* Judging yourself by religious standards forced by questionable sources
* Judging yourself by religious standards upheld by ""clean"" sources
* Hating yourself for not being able to immediately solve anxiety at a moment's notice
* Imagining in detail only the worst cases, but never thinking about the best cases
* Believing that handling the best case outcome needs no thought
* Handling positive outcomes with excitement rather than satisfaction and sense of accomplishment
* Getting easily excited only to lapse into anxiety when the positivity fades
* Believing that perfect permanent safety is necessary first, before even reducing tenseness or alertness
* Believing that your thoughts can affect things done by others
* Believing that your thoughts can affect natural randomness of events
* Believing that certain thoughts are terrible and to be avoided at all costs
* Believing that certain thoughts need to be thought to prevent certain things from happening
* Believing that wrestling with a fear deeper and deeper will somehow affect a real world outcome
* Believing that there is a constant danger to your safety

Any of these is troublesome.

Each of these is a common behaviour of either OCD, Panic disorder or GAD (not all, but one or more of)

None of these are useful 

All of these are harmful and should be unlearned or replaced by healthy behaviours.

Psychology / therapy interventions:
--------------------------------

It might be useful for some to write / print this checklist and put it somewhere you see it daily and stop yourself as soon as you notice yourself doing it.

A large part of anxiety is neurological. So observing behaviours and correcting them is only one way (psychology / therapy)

Mind-Body interventions:
--------------------------------

There are other complementary and amazingly simple and effective ways: EMDR tapping, butterfly hugging, twisting out / shaking off the trauma stored in the nerves and body by doing specific exercises such as vagus nerve regulation exercises, parasympathetic nervous system stimulation exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, etc. 

These are different from muscle-building exercises that sportsmen, athletes and gym enthusiasts perform, are much, much easier and many don't even need you to leave your chair once you learn them. Youtube has at least 3-4 excellent channels that explain how to deal with trauma and pain stored in the body and nerves. I'll add links in replies for whoever is interested, or you can search Youtube with the keywords in the previous paragraph for more results.

Medical interventions:
-----------------------------

Medication is useful when nothing else seems to work. Even medical marijuana or CBD are well known to help, but of course, only taken on the prescription of a licensed and qualified medical practitioner.

Daily life interventions:
-----------------------------

* Cold water is an amazing and instant anxiety antidote. 
* Fermented foods of certain types like yoghurt and buttermilk 
* common comfort foods (though excess might be bad diet) 
* drinking cool water 
* drinking cool fruit juices 
* avoiding stimulants like tea and coffee 
* sleeping half an hour less or an hour more than regular, depending on your current sleep cycle (yes, even sleeping just a little less can take the edge off anxiety because your literally aren't able to think that much - though this is not a thing to make a permanent habit of) 
* extra soft blankets, weighted blankets, soft pillows, soft-to-touch clothing, loose-fitting clothing, soft seating, soft flip-flops / bunny shoes / slippers

It‚Äôs not technically a disciplinary action, but it sure feels like it is.  If it continues, they‚Äôll find out who did and then take disciplinary action.

And so I was basically anxious the whole day.  I do the best I can, but now I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs not good enough.  I really don‚Äôt want to lose my job because it‚Äôs the best first job I could‚Äôve asked for and my coworkers/friends are really cool and they feel like family.

To  start, I am only 19 years old, and realize that certain things will  change overtime and the problems of now may ebb in the future. But I  cannot help but notice some destructive patterns in myself. I realize  that before having a great relationship with someone, loving yourself  first is important, as well as being comfortable in your own skin. There  are periods in my life when I have been graced with such feelings for  sure. But whenever I get emotionally involved with someone, it seems as  if this fades away and gives over to a paranoia and anxiety of being  abandoned and cheated on. No wonder why so many of my past flings had  enough of me. I blamed my insecurities on them, allowed fantasies of  them doing things with my friends in spite of me to take over, and  sometimes acted in an immature manner. I want this cycle to end; to stop  hurting people who probably don't deserve it in the first place.

I've  struggled with this inner battle for a while. The volatile feelings  take over and I give into them, every, single time. I want to be good to  someone for once. Maybe there is something I'm missing about myself.  This has recently spurred due to falling out with someone over my  anxieties. It's tough. I apologized and extended my olive branch, but if  you're me and have apologized for every little action, it doesn't mean  much to another person.

I  recognize that I have not treated people in the past nicely, it haunts  me everyday. Hence why I want this to end--to not be encroached in my  ""dark-side"" so-to-speak before I come into the world more.

1954,vcarp,Helpful Tips!,0,Anxiety,1627149733,"The only way I found to get over ANXIETY Hello there. 

In this post I want to share with you a method that removed a lot of my ANXIETY.

I have used it for years, and it always shows to work and have longterm effects.

&amp;#x200B;

But first, let me just tell you that it may not be simple (like some meditation). And I know it is uncomfortable to read this. I know that it is easier to feel sorry for yourself and be a victim.

As much of a victim as you may be, please try to remove yourself from this mentality. It is not doing you any favours, and will make you stuck with hard anxiety.

So, try to avoid forums like this, too much. Stop always identifying yourself as the anxious person...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, you probably know the answer.

EXPOSURE.

That's it.

The BEST and ONLY (from my experience) way to truly get rid of crippling anxiety is EXPOSURE.

You have to prove to your brain that everything is alright. Nothing bad will happen and you will not die. And even if something bad happens, that you have the strength to deal with it.

Even if it is something that you can logically convince yourself it is not dangerous, your brain will only believe it through real proofs.

&amp;#x200B;

So, make a commitement to yourself that you will overcome it.

Have a plan. We underestimate our power. We underestimate what we can achieve in 5 years.

Start by taking small steps.

If your fear is of going to the supermarket, then on day 1 just stay near the door for 5 seconds and leave. Then go to the next level: enter the supermarket. Then go there and pass by 5 people and leave. Etc.

So, progressively go further. Each time you climb another step, and the effort to go to the next level will not be too overwhelming.

And do not be discouraged! 

If one day you could enter the store, but the next you could not. Then try an easier challenge. Adjust to your fear.

BUT make sure to always push yourself a little bit every day.

Trust me, it will eventually feel very liberating. Like you smoked some weed.

&amp;#x200B;

Just keep on going. Stick to the plan. Whenever you feel very embarassed, see it as a positive (because it is). It means that you survived being embarassed. You showed your brain that it is ok to be embarassed. Keep proving your brain that it is fine. Eventually the fear will start to fade. All you need is persistence, and the belief that it will eventually work. Because it will, if you stick to it. And keep a positive attitude. Celebrate your small (BIG) victories. You were very brave.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this may sound overwhelming. And let me tell you, it will not be a piece of cake. It may be one of the hardest things you've done.

But you got a choice:

Either live your whole life below your potential, always feeling sorry for yourself, and being a victim. And when you are on the hospital bed, be full of regrets.

OR face your fears (slowly, but consistently and methodically), and live a happy and proud life.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not worry if you do not achieve it in 1 month. Have a longer timeline. And eventually compare yourself with your past self, to see how much you've grown."

1959,tiajscott,Sleep,0,Anxiety,1627148768,"Message I sent to my therapist: asking if anyone has other info or a good person/place to ask Last night I was sleeping and I woke up around 2:30AM. As soon as I woke up (I was only really half awake) I had these strange visuals and a really bad feeling. I was visualizing that I was in Star Wars (I have been watching Star Wars with my boyfriend recently) and after a few seconds, I realized that it was just a dream and not real and I consciously recognized that I was just in bed but the visuals would not go away and I had a very bad feeling. I had to jolt myself awake and I had to sit up in bed to make everything go back to normal. I started feeling a little nauseous and I ended up eating some crackers because I thought I was just hungry. I tried to go back to sleep and for about an hour I kept drifting off to sleep and then being jolted awake by the same bad feeling I had before I had woken up fully the first time. Each time I drifted to sleep I began dreaming and even though the dreams themselves weren't bad, I still had a really uncomfortable and bad feeling. It kept me up for a long time and I was almost frightened to go to sleep because I couldn't stop the bad feelings from coming. I eventually fell asleep for good and woke up exhausted. Now I am having anxiety about sleeping again and I'm afraid of it all happening again. Have you ever seen anything like this? Do you know what is happening?
It's worth mentioning that this has happened to me 3 times in my life, but it has not happened since I was 17 (I'm 19 now). In 2 of the 3 times it happened, I had been vaping and using nicotine during the day. I googled the relation between nicotine and dreams but none of the information I found was close to what I was experiencing, and most of the information was about nicotine withdrawals, which I was not having. I tried to tell my parents but they don't really understand what I'm describing."

1963,vcarp,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1627147156,"How to know if your GUILT is justified? I have the tendency to feel very guilty. And I think it is half genetic, half learned from family.

My mother and father also do this. They teach me things like ""if you meet your little cousin, you may not eat an icecream, so he does not feel jealous"". Basically sacrifice wellbeing for the comfort of others.

The thing is, sometimes I have a hard time knowing if I am taking an action because of feeling GUILTY, or because I truly believe it is the most reasonable thing. In the heat of the moment it is always hard to tell.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, when I argument with someone I always tend to understand their point of view, and am very bad at the moment to know if I truly agree, or I am just being influenced by guilt in the moment.

Only later I can reason better and evaluate the situation.

Many times I tend to appologize. I may think I am correct for a couple of hours, but then guilt takes over me and I go appologize.

I have a really hard time knowing my true opinion when ridden with GUILT.

How do you deal with that? Do you have a similar problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Some solutions for this may be:

\-Go the other extrem. Whenever you feel guilty, ignore it and tell yourself ""my brain is playing me tricks."" Eventually it will go away. And do not be afraid of being sometimes unreasonable. Be okay with that, face that discomfort.

\-Start observing how your body feels when you do an action out of GUILT. What I mean, are actions that you later realize were unnecessary (like appologizing, for something you belive you are right). So, basically learn to detect how this feeling FEELS. And whenever it comes, do not do the action your body wants at the moment.

\-Whenver you reached some conclusion while your mind was calm and reasonable, remember that opinion. When you feel yourself with guilt, and a new thought contradicts your previous, know that this new thought is probably not what you truly believe in."

5 years later, i finally got the guts to ask her about it, if it was true, and if so why in the world she would let me do that. she was just as freaked out and concerned as i was. she did her best to reassure me that she would never ever do something gross like that, or anything to hurt me. its worth mentioning that weve always had a great and close relationship and its always been the most positive in my life. there are multiple instances i can think of of her showing healthy boundaries with affection and things like that. which i presume is why the memory is so incongruous and caused so much anxiety. 

her reassurance was enough for me to let it go for a few months, but now its come back. my friends who ive explained the entire thing to think that it is safe to let it go and accept that it the most likely scenario is that it never happened. the thing is‚Ä¶ I AGREE WITH THEM. this memory has no effect on my actual relationship with my mom, or with sex, anything like that.

I have gotten back in touch with everyone since December, but I would still occasionally cut all contacts for weeks at a time for no reason. I get so much anxiety just thinking about having to keep in touch with my friends and reply to their messages and hang out with them. I love my friends and they have been so understanding of my weird habit of simply disappearing, but sometimes I feel like me just disappearing and cutting myself out of their lives wouldn't make a huge impact and it makes me somehow relieved in a messed up way.

When I was in high school I was over weight (trying to lose weight at this moment so far lost over 60 pounds) out of 9 kids I was my mom's heaviest and she kept me in the house all the time didn't want for me to be seen with her. She would take my other sisters every where and buy them all types of things but for me she bought me food back home. I watched all the younger siblings and became their mom. One of my brothers would sleep in my bed every day that's how much bond we had cause I was his parent. Anyways, I grew up without my dad because my mom married someone else and at that time my real dad was in the sheltars trying to get his life together. So I grew up thinking people did like fat people and that no one loved fat people. So I stayed away from people. And grew anxiety around people. 


So that's one thing, and another thing I have a fear of the dark. At night I have to sleep with the TV on. If I don't hear noise I get super anxiety. .

So now that I live with my dad I don't have a lot of friends and I don't really go out only to walk some times. So I recently got a 4 month old kitten and I loved him but became afraid of being scratched and bitten. 

I wish some one can help me what is my problem. Can these things be fixed???"

Ever since I was a kid I had this superstition or ritual or whatever you wanna call it, that I had to do certain things exactly the same way but they were really few and if for some reason I couldn't do it or forgot to it didn't trouble me too much. But as I've gotten older ( especially after my teenage years ) the need to do perform these rituals have become increasingly mandatory. And these rituals are extremely stupid like drinking certain gulps of water or singing certain songs before exams or doing certain things before/after certain time etc. While some of these rituals are a bit permanent most of these have changed over time.

 And all this while my anxiety has also been slowly growing. First it was just about studies, then health and so on and so forth. Now I'm at a point where I get anxious about literally everything. Sometimes when I'm really anxious performing one of my rituals help a bit. I have a feeling that this effect has caused me to become resistant to change. I want everything to be like it is and even a slight change in my daily routine can cause huge anxiety. A couple of hours ago I decided to move my bed just a few feet to make space for a new drawer I was planning on buying( room has been the same ever since I moved in 2 years ago ) and this little change made me so anxious that I couldnt function properly and I had to move the bed back to the same position as it was before.

I have Somatic Symptom Disorder and GAD. This basically means that every bit of stress I experience gets turned into physical symptoms and everything stresses me out.

I am on a three day vacation with my mom, her boyfriend and my sister(12/F). We are staying in an small Airbnb and planned to rent a boat. On the first day we drove out but the house wasn‚Äôt ready so we went to a restaurant. Once we sat down I started panicking for a reason I still can‚Äôt understand myself. The first symptom was me scratching my arm. My mom‚Äôs boyfriend was angry at me because ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt trying to stop‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is no way I don‚Äôt know what was causing it‚Äù along with some other quotes. At that point I started panicking more and started to draw blood. My mom then walked me out and to the car where I proceeded to have a full blown panic attack. I don‚Äôt want to get into to many details here but what he said to me was making it worse. Know I won‚Äôt going in the boat with him because I am worried about any more possible panic attacks and his reaction. My mom talked to him about it but he hasn‚Äôt said anything about it to me and I think he believes I was just making a scene.

For a long time, I always had these two big chained weights around my ankles: 1.) Being that I never had a job 2.) Being that I've never been in a relationship are really been intimate with another person before. I always felt a lot of self-shame about these two things and assumed that people would see me the way that I saw myself, which kept me from trying for a long time. However, I started applying for jobs and realized it wasn't that scary anymore and then I started talking to interviewers and realized that they didn't care about the stuff I cared about. I'm sure that's probably true for most of you, we're our own worst enemy inside our craniums. I ended up getting a job and at first I felt so much emotion because it was such a long time coming for me to get to this point, but afterwards I just felt stupid for trapping myself in so many tiny boxes and like I wasted 15 years being worried about things that could never be as bad as I imagined them to be. 

Obviously, my anxiety is still present but I'm doing the best I can because I'm tired of not having any progression in my life. When you stay stagnant for so long, it can feel like you're stuck and there's no way forward. I always had this really particular order of: I have to finish college to get a job, i need a job to get an apartment, and I need an apartment to get a girlfriend. It's such an inflexible way of thinking about things. Maybe I could have found a girlfriend earlier who didn't care that I didn't have a job or lived with a parent, maybe I still can. Just because the culture of the United States promotes that you have to move out with your parents ASAP doesn't mean it's the right one. Anyway, I don't want to ramble too much. 

The last thing I really want to mention to you all is to please not invest everything into one person. As I told yall in my previous post, I lost my confidant which I kind of build my world around completely for 3-5 years. I've done something similar to this about three times now and I think the universe is trying to just prove its point to me that it's not good and it doesn't work but I'm a little dumb. People change, you change. I know it's hard to find more than one person but you have to keep trying even if you think you found what you need in that person. You don't want to be left holding the ashes when they decide they want to be more independent, career focused, or whatever else they may aspire to be. It's important to be okay with being with yourself. I've been really struggling without her, it even soured the fact that I finally got a job because she wasn't there to be my biggest fan. She had spent 5 years seeing me at the bottom and I finally get to the top and she just has other things going on in her life. I think one of my goals going forward needs to be to being happy for myself rather than needing validation from others but it's obviously easier said than done."

2042,AnxietyMostofTheTime,Needs A Hug/Support,5,Anxiety,1622397545,"Anxiety has dominated me since I was a child (some triggers) Triggers for addiction, divorce....

I was a kid with an overbite and crooked teeth, really crooked teeth. Naturally this brought in some bullying then some really unhealthy anxiety levels. I still remember the panic as a kid. 

My parents divorced before my teenage years and I still remember the fights, the screaming, the throwing of things, the custody fights. I still remember vividly, years later. 

I remember being teased about my physical appearance in middle school, then high school. I remember never wanting to open my mouth to smile because my teeth were so bad. I actively avoided smiling. Because then someone would see my teeth. 

Then the sweating happened. I would sweat heavily from my face when under stress, which was 90% of the time. All of the ‚Äúwhy are you sweating?‚Äù observations did not help my cause. 

Later I would get my teeth fixed but the psychological damage was done. It was burned deep into my soul. 

In my early 20s I was fed up. I went to see a doctor. I was prescribed a benzodiazepine. Me being so obsessed with my anxiety was just happy to have found a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù. No more anxiety, full confidence and new opportunities. 

Many good things happened during this period. I got married, made strides at work and did things that would normally scare the life out of me. 

With that came a 4 year addiction. The drug stopped working. I didn‚Äôt know that this was a short term drug. My doctor happily refilled this same prescription for years. 

Now, I‚Äôm 28. Trying to hang on to my sanity. I never once thought that I‚Äôd be addicted to pills. I became physically dependent. I avoided drugs because I was scared but somehow ended up hooked on prescription medicine. I‚Äôm in the process of being off of them. 

My only option is to come off these meds. I never knew it would be so hard. 

Now my anxiety is back full force. I‚Äôm in panic mode all the time. This is no way to live.  I thought I had an answer to my anxiety. I was wrong. Why am I like this? Why do I have to suffer with this disease every moment of my waking life?

Anxiety dominates my life."

I'm not even sure what the trigger is; all my co-workers and managers are so kind and patient, and the customers are like 75% polite. I do have general social anxiety so I'm assuming the large number of people is the problem.

I'm trying to find something less triggering. I'm considering working at Kroger but I think I could only handle bagging/stocking/cleaing; ie not working register. Will it hurt my chances of getting the job to be upfront about my anxiety and limitations during the interview?

I'd also love to do something that has virtually no social aspect, like proofreading or data entry, but I have no real qualifications.

Any advice would be so appreciated :)

I don‚Äôt know if this will just get lost on the internet and I‚Äôll probably just delete it because something like 2 people will see if I‚Äôm lucky. I apologize for the length - there‚Äôs just a lot on my plate that has happened the last year. 

I guess a bit about me. I am 22 and a first gen grad. I just graduated in December with 2 bachelors, 2 minors, a certificate, and was the first one in one of my degrees to do honors. After a few months soul draining job searching, I finally have a full time position that starts in June with decent pay and benefits. I decided to live at home during my 4.5 years of college to save tons of money (I estimate I‚Äôve saved ~$40k-$60k by doing so). I initially thought I‚Äôd at least be out by my last year and had goals of getting a full time offer right away so I could be mostly independent. I had paid for almost all of my tuition and wanted to start being able to handle living expenses. 

At least, those were my plans (more like expectations I‚Äôd placed on myself). Then of course, COVID happened. I was already working and studying in healthcare when my life became even more consumed by it. I worked on a COVID unit for a month and saw things first hand before I had to start an internship I already had lined up before. But that month is still in my brain - just seeing so much deteriorating human beings and hearing about heartbreaking stories. We were badly hit compared to others in the state and during this month, George Floyd happened 20 minutes away. I‚Äôd go from taking care of COVID+ patients inside to coming across about COVID across the country, long coming social justice issues, and my city on fire - the same one where I went to school and had friends living in. COVID also accelerated the end of my first long-term relationship of 1.5 years. Then dealing with healthcare topics again in class. And again in fall 2020 when my IUD was causing problems and doctors couldn‚Äôt initially figure out what it was. I started to really question whether something I‚Äôm passionate about it really for me. 

On top, I grew up with a rocky and kind of nonexistent relationship with my parents. My mom can be described as an emotionally unavailable narcissistic or ‚Äún-mom‚Äù (yes I‚Äôve been on that sub) and it‚Äôs mainly culture friction. I grew up with physical and emotional abuse that she denies. I have things engrained in me that I‚Äôm really trying to unlearn: the love is conditional, boundaries don‚Äôt really exist, self-doubt, feelings of control, that I‚Äôm unlovable and selfish, a liar, broken, lazy, dumb, and more. My parents have vastly different ideas and values than me and hold it against their children - for example, since you support BLM we will stop helping you pay for college because higher education brainwashes kids into being liberals. I literally didn‚Äôt talk to my dad for a year because we had an argument over BLM. To be clear, I‚Äôm fine with them believing what they want to but they will not agree to disagree and instead choose to insert it to break the family up even more so. My youngest sister, who I used to be close with, hasn‚Äôt talked to me in over 1.5 years either and we live together. 

I feel like I am doing everything wrong. I‚Äôve been to therapy for 6 years now and meds for almost the same amount of time. However, I started having anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts at age 13. I‚Äôm 3 years and 3 months clean from self harm and was on track in fall 2019-early 2020 to feeling the best mentally and emotionally in almost a decade until covid came. Then everything went downhill. Despite my strides with my education and career, I can‚Äôt feel proud or accomplished at all. I feel like everything just became even harder and I became burnt out. My psychiatrist put me on another depression med that she said would be very short term, but it‚Äôs been 6 months. I only have 2 close friends who know about me on a personal level and one just moved a couple states over. I struggle with my anxious attachment styles and tried casual dating for the past few months (with COVID precautions in mind). I had an amazing 2-3 weeks with someone who I felt I ‚Äúclicked‚Äù with more than anybody else that soon. That is, until he clarified that he‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt *any* commitment at all. He stepped back in order to focus on himself and getting over a past toxic relationship. And to keep things easy, we meet only if our schedules happen to line up (versus meeting weekly and talking constantly as we had been). I respect his honesty and have realized the reason I am so disappointed is because I had way more emotional investment than I should‚Äôve. I just had such good feelings about our connection. 

For every 1 step forward, I feel like I‚Äôm taking 3 steps back. I just want to curl up and cry until I am numb. I am trying so hard to do things that I feel are good for me - why does it feel like I‚Äôm moving backwards instead. I hate my inability to just be happy and proud for myself. I know I need to work towards more self-care, self-love, and self-compassion. But I feel like I will never ever get there."

2049,martedd,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1622394776,"Quickly it has taken control of my entire life Hello all,

I am 22M and was diagnosed with anxiety as well as depression at a very young age. The reason I am posting this is because maybe some of you could relate and give me a little life advice.

I have always been anxious, had panic attacks in stressful situations, and participated in self-destructive behavior to relieve said anxiety. But, in the last 2 years my anxiety has crept up to the point at which it is completely destroying my life. This last year was my last year of college and I assumed that the increase in frequency of these panic attacks was due to that.  The last 2 months have almost been exclusively daily panic attacks (anywhere from 1-15+). I have done the right thing and am meeting with a psychiatrist for medications and coping techniques but it wont be until the end of June.

The last week has been virtually unlivable. I have multiple panic attacks every single day now which as caused me to lose some weight, sleep in extremely weird ways, and crave an escape. My friends, family, and girlfriend are all worried about me. Seemingly, any random trigger is enough to spark the panic attack which will last from 20 minutes to an hour (context dependent). 

The panic attacks are beginning to feel cyclical, as if I am living in a never ending roller coaster of violent anxiety to immobile depression.

I want to emphasize that I am not a threat to myself as I do want to get help and do not want to self-harm. Is there any strategies to decrease the frequency of my attacks? Is there anywhere I can go for immediate assistance (besides the ER cause they'll probably lock me up)? Idk what I'm asking anymore. Just looking for help here."

We've been together for almost 7 yrs, but for the last weeks I've been feeling anxious about us. We were usually caring and loving, but when we fought things were ugly, and never really progressed.
Our problems were stupid, and just got bigger and bigger every time.

For some reason we ended ""living"" together for the last month, and it was okay I guess. We love each other so much, but wasn't feeling good lately regarding us.

I'm really scared I might be pregnant, but don't want to do a test bc of bad anxiety. And the biggest fear I've been feeling is that I ended up with him not ready to settle down.

Now, I've made my biggest fear come true, and I believe the good thing is I recognized yesterday was all an anxiety attack.

Today I feel like drowning. I feel stupid. I want him back.
I know we'll eventually be okay with or without each other.

Just don't know if I should keep trying to get him back, or leave him alone. Sometimes I feel everyone might feel better without me.

As a teenager I showed so much promise, had many friends and was thriving academically. However in my late teens I became very unwell eventually ending up hospitalised and diagnosed with Bipolar type 1. 

Over the years I have lost more confidence and experience anxiety even when not manic or depressed. This anxiety mostly comes as intrusive thoughts or images of things going wrong/ people getting hurt. I also have severe anxiety and panic attacks when leaving the house which means I cannot leave unless with a trusted person and even then cannot go far or get on public transport. Despite this I come across very high functional if my mood is stable. I rarely look visually anxious as I avoid situations that cause that amount of anxiety so people probably don't realise how much it affects me. 

I feel really embarrassed asking for help or being open about these anxieties as I feel silly for not being able to do everything myself now I am an adult and most my friends have degrees and jobs. Even when I haven't had a manic or depressive episode I still haven't been able to find the work I want as I cannot leave the house and I know working at home would seriously isolate me. I am currently trying to gain confidence leaving my house and look for jobs but  I am feeling kinda depressed following a bad manic episode that landed me in hospital.

I feel like everyone is so much more functional than me... why can't I just get over this..

2077,Alternative-Proof-90,Needs A Hug/Support,2,Anxiety,1622386002,"What is wrong with me? Since years I am feeling that something is off with me. Wherever I go and meet new people I always feel that these people present themselves as more superior towards me and I am wondering why they have so much more confidence than I have or why they do not care how others perceive them.

In high school I was walked all over, guys called me ugly although I think that I became a pretty woman. I never belonged to the ""cool people"" and I always felt a weird chemistry between people who are cooler than me. The more trauma I went through, the more I think that I am a doormat . For example, when I walk on the street people do not make space for me and bump into me without saying sorry or people just being rude for no reason. 

I am done with being nice but every time I am trying to appear confident I cannot erase the feeling of inferiority inside of me. It is bothering me so much. There is no balance in me, its black or white, I am feeling bad or I am compensating my insecurity by being too aggressive towards people.  I literally avoid everything, its like a wall in front of my mind. I feel insecure, depressed, I am anxious all the time, indecisive, and I am destroying my success and relationships.

 I feel like a complete failure because I do not even have a college degree at the age of 26. Every time I am in a new group I just want to leave, and not be bothered by anyone, I just want to be on my own because it is exhausting to me that people dominate and disrespect me. For instance, I had a girl in my class who always said I am a lesbian because she just ""knows "" and ""we will see, in 10 years I will be a lesbian"". Its like people just talk stuff without caring. It is also exhausting that I cannot be in a classroom without feeling anxious all the time, I just want to be able to relax and just be me. 

I wanted to have a family at this age and now I do not even have a qualification to start a career. I feel like my time is ticking and I see no worth in my life anymore.

But I've never really worried about them. In October of 2019, I developed really bad anxiety, it came on after a bad interaction with alcohol, we're not going to go there.

2083,readthisifyourgay598,DAE Questions,7,Anxiety,1622382262,"Anxiety from sunlight? Is this a thing? Hi,

This is something I've been noticing for a while- despite loving sunny weather, I always (and nowadays almost exclusively) get symptoms of panic attacks on warm, sunny days. 

My country has had very variable weather recently so I've had ample opportunities to compare consecutive days with very different weather. I go outside and do similar stuff whatever the conditions- I don't overheat or anything, and I tend to be in my garden or out in the countryside (away from the crowds that come out on sunny days)- so I don't think that these are the main contributing factors. Instead it seems to be the actual amount of sunlight hitting my skin. As a result wearing long-sleeves or a jumper makes me less anxious, everything else being equal. 

Does anyone else get this? Any idea why it could be? 

Thanks!"

I found myself talking to his daugher (shes 25, i'm 27), I was under a lot of stress but I was able to hide it very well, for some reason under extreme stress my stutter stops (talk about weird brain, huh?) and I seemed extremely confident, it's normally like that but I know that after it ends I'll pay the price later if I did something stupid  (lol, reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB01rSkSS94)).

Anyhow, I had a really good time, she seemed very smart and shares a lot of my hobbies, everything felt great and smooth.

My mom talked to her dad today at her work he really liked me, and I know shes single, so I figured why not text her? so I did text her like two hours ago, she has been online a few times since and she did not reply and honestly it feels really bad, my stomache is turning just by the fact I sent her a message, you know that feeling that you feel sick because you sent someone a message and he's not responding? yet at the same time there's a glimpse of hope he won't answer so you won't find yourself in an even more awkward situation?

But I guess that on the bright side, my social anxiety was gone for some reason, I mean I was anxious but I think in a normal way, if that makes sense (I've been working on it a lot lately) and I'm pretty proud of how I acted during that conversation, if someone had looked at me from outside, he must've thought ""damn, the amount of confidence he has is impressive"" but not knowing inside its a tower of cards lol.

I'm a 26y (F) and I have been suffering from panic attacks since I was 17. My first one was while I was on my side job, on the counter in front of customers. It was horrible. My body completely detached itself from my mind, I did things I wasn't in control of (hitting people, forcing myself onto the ground, heart palpations, etc.). I did not have a history of anxiety, and this was completely new for me. It happened, we went to the ER and of course, a panic attack. Unfortunately since then, it only became worse and not better. Three years ago is when it all went south. Not only am I suffering from panic attacks, I can't even handle panic or stress or any emotions without fainting. I just drop to the ground, and usually I can get up pretty quick, but a few times it follows with a panic attack. Normally my panic attacks are pretty mild, just the usual 'I feel heart palpations, I'm sweating, I can't breathe normal', but sometimes, they are severe and it is literally me screaming, crying, moving my hands and feet uncontrollably, and last for hours. These only come like once in half a year. They also trigger my fainting and it is just a viscous circle which never ends. However, the past month it has been becoming worse and worse. In a time span of 3 weeks I had these severe panic attacks, and I fainted even 2 times in a day (not normal). I have been googling and googling, and I just don't know what to do anymore. Many times I can kinda pinpoints my panic attacks, but lately they have been so out of the blue, that I just don't know anymore. I have been seeing a therapist, which said I suffer from PNES (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures), and I've been in therapy for 3 months. However I have never been checked by a neurologist, and many people who saw me faint just find it weird that it all psychogenic. I am extremely grateful that I have the ability to still be able to work full-time, it has been really hard. Sometimes I faint up to 8x in a month, but what else should I do? Stay at home? And then what? My anxiety is bad when I am jobless, my anxiety is bad when I do work, my anxiety is bad when I days off. It is just non-stop, I tried meditation, eating healthier (which also causes anxiety, cause I had an eating disorder), everything in the books. I'm just done. Do I even wanna try medication at this point? Is that gonna help me or make stuff worse? Is there anything in my life that has to change? If so, what? I honestly don't know anymore. I feel so defeated. I just want answers. I wanna go on with my life and get my driving license. I wanna be able to walk those hallways at work without seeing the faces of the people who saw me suffer. I don't wanna be the talk of the office. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I know it's bad, it's been like that since forever. I just want my anxiety to fade away. I wanna be able to find a new job if I ever want that, and not think 'ok, but who is gonna hire a fainting panic attack gal in a freaking lab?' honestly, who is going to? This was just a one-in-a-million chance and I got lucky.  I just don't want to think and plan my whole life around this one thing. I want to control it, and not vice versa. I just want my body and mind back. I don't want to suffer anymore.

Sorry if my English is a bit bad - it's not my first language.

TL;DR: I hate anxiety and fainting, especially the combo."

I have past event OCD as well. So 1.5 years ago I was at uni and during the lecture I was pretending to sleep. I was just whining while I slept for attention from my friends and crush for fun:P (you know the cute sounds people make while they sleep)
Not at all surprisingly nobody gave me attention and when I woke up my friend just said ""you were making sex sounds"". I don't think that's what I intended. She said it as a friendly insult and we laughed and I forgot about it till today. Today suddenly I remembered that occasion and now I'm trying to remember whether or not I actually intended to make sex sounds. Part of me doesnt think so but another part is believing it.

2100,abezzzy,Relationship,0,Anxiety,1612963996,"Anxiety in the Relationship First time poster, just came across this sub and was hoping that someone can relate and maybe share any insight or advice, thank you all in advanced.

So I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember (24f) and most of it surrounds an overwhelming sense of worry in my interpersonal relationships. With my boyfriend, my friends, my siblings, etc. This worry is what I think to be cause from pass trauma - Parents divorced at age 9, was in a \~8 year relationship with someone from age 15-2 that was very manipulating, I was completely fucked over for lack of better words, with my ex and many friends along my childhood into adulthood. I seem to surround myself around people who are toxic! And they burned me every time.

Now I am in a relationship with a great guy, and have some really great friends, But my problem is I am still always assuming that they are ""out to get me"" in some way, or just not on ""my side"" for small things. To give an example, my partner will say certain things, that I take out of context and misunderstand because I assume he is mad at me or upset with me, when it was just an honest question and he means no harm. So I am reading into almost all conversations, and not just taking them for face value! I am able to reflect on this instances later, and apologize for my actions if need me, but it is so frustrating that this mindset seems to be burned in my brain, I'm not sure how to snap out of it! He could ask me a question about pasta sauce I'm making, and I will assume that he is saying my pasta sauce is shit, and then I will get defensive, and he's left being like ""wtf did I do?"" ...

I am in the process of seeking a therapist now, which I hope will help. But my partner is getting tired. He doesn't want to give up because he loves me so much, but it is hard for him where he feels he is thought to be the bad guy all the time (by me). Which he's not.

I'm happy to answer any questions if anyone would like to know more information to get a better understanding. Anxiety in the Relationship"

It's 6am following the second day as I write this, and right now everything just feels like anxiety.
I have sleep issues and I haven't taken any of my meds. My head keeps twitching, but I don't know if it's cause it would do this normally or because I hit my head. Going to the doctor is out of the option anyway because I can't take myself there.
There were times during the summer I couldn't sleep for days and once I collapsef at a regular appointment (I know why for both of those reasons- severe stress and low blood pressure) and my parents laughed at me, mocked me, and basically said I was a giant inconvenience.

2109,smolandworried,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1612960713,"Advise on processing change so I can support my friend My anxiety is routed pretty heavily in that I really struggle with change. I get anxious and worried that the small stability in my life that I rely on will crumble with even the slightest change e.g for dnd I didnt want anyonelse to join  even though I love the person in case it 'changed' things. I cant handle changes to schedules, or even when someone changes their appareance drastically it throws me because I dissociate.

My best friend came out as trans yesterday to me. I LOVE her, I call her daily and we both rely on each other a lot. I've always seen her and known her as a guy and I really never would have guessed this. I want and NEED to support her, make sure she knows she is still the same and I love her, and I do. If this is who she is, this is who she is simple as and I've always been supportive of trans. Which is why its killing me that I can feel my anxiety bubble up over what changes will be coming. She will look different, I need to make sure I register in my head that she is a female, call her by a new name etc. My head is swirling wondering what will change now, will how she interacts with me change now that she is going to be expressing who she is more? How much of what we did before was her 'acting' as a man, whats gonna change? Will she show interest in makeup and everything and is that gonna be our activities together now. 

Its so stupid and selfish but I cant stop the anxiety bubbling just worrying if im going to lose anything we once had. Now I have anxiety that she might notice im anxious and feel bad about being trans which absolutely cannot happen. She needs me, I want to be her rock and help her be confident in becoming who she is. 

Why is my brain wired like this, I just want to support my friend when she needs me most and I dont know how to quiet this pointless anxiety about change. I also have no clue how to help someone who is struggling with their gender identity. 

I've said she could come visit here post covid where she could be free to introduce herself as a woman without having to explain (as no one would know her previously and I live in a very inclusive area). 

I hate that I have this anxiety about change, she's still the same person really im just worried im going to dissociate again because that's just what my brain does with the unfamiliar.

I have actually had a panic attack when a piece of kale got stuck in my throat at a restaurant when eating with a friend, though a small piece and not blocking my airway at all I started panicking and crying.

I even sometimes have to plan ahead if I know I have food plans with someone, I‚Äôll need to see the menu beforehand and feel out which foods are easy to swallow.

TL;DR at the bottom

I'm a software engineer. I've been anxious about most of the things right from my childhood. But with time I was able to cope up with smaller issues. After graduating from college and having experience of 3.5 years in software development, here's a new problem I've started to face.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company A:**

Whenever I've got an interview with tech giants or the companies I'm passionate about, I start to overthink the scenarios. In the morning as I wake up, I just wanna lie down over my chest in the bed. Just a few hours before the interview I'll roam around aimlessly.

During the interview, I'm not able to think clearly and start making silly mistakes. I'm not confident enough over my solutions and in some cases, I even give the wrong answer. I'm not able to articulate my solutions properly, going back and forth between approaches. I tend to use a lot of ""umm"" as I'm speaking.  I also start to overthink ""c'mon you don't have that much time left, come up with an optimized solution quickly"". With this behavior, it's very obvious for the interviewer to think that he is not qualified and confident enough. And I totally agree with him/her, even I wouldn't select myself.

Yesterday I got rejected by another big tech giant. I was not able to even crack the first round. The worst part is I knew the solution but was not able to explain it to the interviewer properly.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company B:**

These things don't happen when I'm giving a mock interview alone or if I've got an interview with smaller companies and startups. I'm anxious not gonna lie but I'm used to that level of anxiety. I'm confident and able to think very clearly. With these interviews, I tend to have a very healthy discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I can't have all the interviews to go perfectly, but I'm sure if I don't get anxious I'll have a better chance at cracking them.

&amp;#x200B;

If any of you guys have gone through such an experience, how did you cope up with this?  Any suggestion on how I can give the interview for **Company A** just like I give the interview for **Company B**.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

During the interviews with tech giants or the companies I'm passionate about, I get anxious. But I get a lot less anxious when I'm giving a mock interview alone or if I've got an interview with smaller companies and startups. Any suggestions to overcome my anxiety with interviews of former kind companies."

2151,Ghost_Gamer_918,Needs A Hug/Support,0,Anxiety,1612937500,"The last year in isolation made my anxiety finally get out of control and I feel like I am mourning myself. This is coming from my heart. I am being very honest, and felt like writing it this way (22M) This is a story of the best version of me. The bravest me there ever was, the one who had the courage to try and drop his burdens, and getting outside to the world. This was the first me to feel happy and realized in a long time, and the one who felt hope in the future, who believed he could be better. He was willing to throw himself into the unknown, knowing the reward could be great. He got to live an adventure he never thought he would have. 

After being alone for a long time, he found true friends, he explored places away from home, and lived where he had never been before. Away from his home, he felt free. He learned to travel alone, and although it took time, he learned to not fear, and forget about all those ideas that were for years in his mind. He fought all the wrong ideas he had about himself, and found out he was useful. Someone who knew he could do great things if he put his mind to it. He learned to get to know people first before judging them, before thinking they would not like him, and this brought him unexpected allies, confidence he never thought possible to have, and some very good moments and laughs. He sometimes felt down, and was still haunted by memories and thoughts. But even though he remembered the past constantly, he had resolved that he wouldn't let his thoughts bring him back to where he had come from. He was brave, he ignored whatever signals his body told him to pay attention to, because deep down he knew what was causing them, and trusted he could get out of it. He stopped fearing about his health, and started living a day at a time. He no longer feared horror, but rather understood it. He was a good young man... But he didn't seek help on time. 

He made that mistake. He still couldn't get away of what acursed him, but he never made time to seek the right help to make the final push. The final push, to freedom.
Without a warning, he suddenly was caged again. His freedom, and the independence that was so close he could see it, suddenly wasn't there anymore. He no longer had control over himself, and no longer had a say on what he wanted or what he thought. It wasn't valid anymore. All those connections he had worked so hard to make, disappeared in the blink of an eye. There he was, alone again. The ones that called themselves family, refused to acknowledge what was happening to him, and refused to give him the help he asked them for.
He was broken that day, his happiness banished. Fear slowly filled him again.

I am mourning myself, and have been doing it for some time now. He was the best me, I worked so hard to make him a better person, and it makes me so sad and angry that I lost him. I cannot express the sadness, and the anger, that I'm feeling. I hope you can understand what I'm feeling right now, if you have ever mourned yourself. It's the best way I can describe it. It enrages me to know I was close to beating the curse that is anxiety, only to be forced back to a home where I'm not understood and invalidated. I miss my friends, but it has been almost a year now. Maybe I should give up seeing them again. I haven't talked to someone my age for almost a year. I'm introverted, but the isolation has been unbearable. I'm about to finish college but I feel like I can't do it, I cannot concentrate. It's hard to sleep. The sadness doesn't go away, and I have fear again. Constant fear for my health again. I feel like I'm going to die. And being honest, I would like to, I am just... tired.

The flare in this post is because I feel broken right now. I just wanted for once to express myself without being invalidated and told I'm doing it because I want attention or I'm just being dramatic or edgy and that mental disorders are not real. Yes, they really think that here at home. What I'm feeling is real. I hope someone understands and can relate"

After explaining this to the doc I mentioned that I was hearing people talk about me through walls. She became very concerned and explained to me that I could be having a psychotic episode. This really scared me - as it was just before Christmas and I didn't want to be in a bad state around my family. 

It was scary epecially because I trusted her opinion, I had gone out of my way to see her at a time where everything scared me and I had no clue what was going on. The news honestly freaked me out, mainly because I have been like this for years. Smoking just made the issue more noticeable. 

Nothing ever came out of it.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently I met up with an old co-worker. I had left my old job just before the whole doc experience happened, so I filled her in. I am F19 and shes around 45, so during the time we worked together we developed a very sweet mother - daughter type relationship, so she knew me pretty well. She was shocked and told me that I am NOT psychotic, that it was probably just some anxiety that got out of control.

Now looking back I realised that I had phrased it wrong to my doc. I DEFINIETY DO think people are talking about me when I hear mumbling freom another room - even to this day. I always keep a fan going to drown out the noise. But it's not me deciphering the words, or hearing things that aren't there. 

This is a very reliving breakthrough for me. There is many parts of the sotry I've missed out, as I could go on forever explaining the details.

I‚Äôve been suffering from severe anxiety for 8-10weeks, social anxiety. Struggling in car because there is no nearby toilet. Worrying thoughts of people seeing me diarrhoea or vomit etc. i basically stopped myself going out, going for walks were hard. So obviously this affected him too. 

He was supportive during the relationship, trying to be a cheerleader for me.

However he said he didn‚Äôt feel wanted/needed by me because I didn‚Äôt call him during an anxiety attack but would tell him 1 hour after it happened. 

Examples:
3 hour hairdressers, I read my book to keep myself in check. Text him 1 hour saying it was hard but got through it. I‚Äôm good now. 

First day back at work. He says we should be a team, be each other‚Äôs number one and not leaning on my mum as much. First day back is ‚Äòour first day back‚Äô he says. At the end of my shift I reply to him and say had a small attack at the beginning but I‚Äôm all good now, shift went well (etc). He said it should have been a courtesy text as he was thinking about me all day. 

In the end he says he just doesn‚Äôt understand my anxiety. 

When I have an anxiety attack I focus on getting myself through it, once it‚Äôs over then I‚Äôll let a significant other know ‚Äòhey just had one before, but all okay now.‚Äô I don‚Äôt want to draw attention to it, I‚Äôm just letting you know.

I have been struggling with derealization for the past two or so months and it puts me on the brink of crying in the evening when I am done with all of my university studies (if I can manage to do them). I don‚Äôt know what to do. Every morning when I wake up, my brain forcefully thinks ‚Äútoday is going to be like yesterday‚Äù which then puts me on a path to anxiety for the rest of the day. I‚Äôm a 23 year old guy which makes it so much worse; it‚Äôs so difficult to talk about things with other people that you feel you will be judged for. I talk with a therapist once a week and not even him I can tell one of my most embarrassing thoughts that contributes to my every day anxiety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the middle of nowhere and it‚Äôs 0 degrees F outside almost every day. I almost feel trapped in my apartment, even though I‚Äôm able to sometimes walk to the library and get my studies done; other than that, it‚Äôs just me in my apartment trapped with my thoughts. I try to distract myself by doing things that I enjoy, like watching soccer or throwing some darts, but even then, it‚Äôs so difficult to take my mind off of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I often compare myself to other people, how I stand up against them and I often imagine how their lives are with no anxiety. Now obviously I don‚Äôt know that they don‚Äôt have anxiety like myself but I always see them in that way. I imagine that they‚Äôre probably in relationships with other people and able to spend time with them. This is what really makes me sad. I imagine myself having a girlfriend but then I immediately think ‚Äúwhat if she doesn‚Äôt understand my anxiety‚Äù or something along those lines and it‚Äôs made me cry a couple of times. Call me a bitch or a pussy if you want, but this is what I‚Äôve been too afraid to tell anyone, that I‚Äôm 23 years old in the prime of my life and the anxiety is holding me down. I want to care for someone so much, be there for someone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt feel needed by anyone. I am such a friendly person it‚Äôs unbelievable, and I‚Äôm not just saying that to make myself look good. For my entire life, I‚Äôve been raised to put others‚Äô needs before my own and that‚Äôs still how I live today. I work the front desk at a hotel near my university and I‚Äôve always had a strong work ethic; I go above and beyond here because as I said previously, it‚Äôs in my DNA to put other peoples‚Äô needs before mine whether that be other guests or my coworkers. I often fill in other coworkers‚Äô shifts if they need the day off or do tasks that go beyond what I‚Äôm supposed to do as a front desk associate. I haven‚Äôt been told at all by anyone that I‚Äôm doing a great job or that they‚Äôre glad to have me working there with them. I don‚Äôt even know if they (management) know how hard I work. I‚Äôve had no evaluations done or anything, for all I know, I could be doing a horrible job according to their standards.

Not sure if the above makes sense but, I feel like for 10 years + all I've ever known is having anxiety/mental illnesses etc and when I get given techniques to conquer these issues by counsellors, I fear getting better as I don't know what it's like to be mentally healthy. It's like I prefer being ill as it's more familiar.

I have a feeling that maybe a main cause is that these techniques (like breathing, 5 senses, worry time) only fix the symptoms of anxiety and not the triggers or the cause of my anxiety and when it comes to talking to counsellors I can never really get it across to them the way I want it to and I end up just jumping all over the show."

Really affecting professional ambitions as I cannot focus.

One bad thing I do is maladaptive day dream for the majority of my waking hours it provides me with a comfort I struggle to find in my own reality. I daydream about a girl that I can talk to about my emotions because I could never do that in my real life or of an idealised version of my self.

When I reached 16 I started using mdma, coke, bingo, weed and abused alcohol to disassociate and have been trying to stop but have moments of weakness most recently last week.

I constantly feel as if everyone hates me and as if people are working against me. Even in school I would go against teachers and study solo in the library. I just want to be able to focus on my hobbies and goals without constantly over worrying in my reality or using daydreaming as an unhealthy escape.

I am an objectively intelligent person (Second best academic award at my school, straight A's never had to work hard, always late for school) but I really struggle to write down my emotions as I have never discussed them with anyone. I feel as if discussing them anonymously on here could help give me the confidence to maybe open up to my mother in real life and hopefully reduce my daydreaming and anxiety. 

Please can someone message me who knows how to deal with these feelings and help me however if not I understand.

One of the contributors was my Grandmother. My mother moved us into my Grandparent's basement when I was 7 and my Grandmother was very abusive. We didn't have doors on any rooms (except the bathroom, but the doors didn't lock) and I could be doing anything and she would burst in and start yelling at me for whatever I was doing. All these years later, I still get very nervous when I hear somebody in the doorway unexpectedly or when I'm doing something and my partner is not home but I expect him home. I know logically that he would never treat me like that but it still causes me so much intense stress.
He has a habit of telling me he'll be home at a certain time but not actually coming home at that time. So say I expect him at 7; from 7:01 until the moment he comes home I have knots in my stomach waiting for the interruption to whatever I'm doing in our tiny apartment. This can go on for hours and I just can't handle it. 
I obviously don't blame him for any of this but I wish he could pay more attention to the time and let me know an updated or more accurate time to expect him. Is that fair of me to ask? Can anyone relate?"

2180,anotherhourwasted, ,0,Anxiety,1612898589,"Anxiety + Aggression? I have mild anxiety attacks meaning I am actually able to calm me down to the point that I don't need supervision or medical help (has been worse tho).

Thing is, it seems my anxiety is linked to aggression? I always have been an aggressive person meaning I'd rather crush others than myself (I am very peaceful though, I mean I just get defensive-aggressive when attacked. I do not wish to harm people who've never done me any harm and I definitely do not enjoy violence in general).

My anxiety attacks started when I started to not let my fear and aggression out (I would usually rant heavily to a close friend, I don't destroy things) and instead directed it onto myself. This has happened partly bc I was in a toxic relationship with gaslighting and over-emotionalizing. I was made to believe I was severely depressed, and that actually kicked me into depression.

My anxiety attacks started when I refused to ""fight"" a fight bc I believed it to be wrong, as in aggression is bad no matter how. I felt helplessness, sometimes the conflicts were some that could not be beat with aggression (except killing all people involved with is obviously a no-go option). 
I generally seem to get anxiety attacks when I am attacked and made the villain without a chance to defend myself. This is a problem especially online, and the reason why I am very shy in writing things on social media. It has happened on reddit as well and I will probably delete my account at some point, but I wanted to try and ask here.

So, I sometimes think my anxiety happens when I try to control my aggression (I am normally a fighter type of person), or when a conflict can not be fought in any way, including arguments. I have all this bad energy in me which has to be shut in and I can't cope with it, it burns me and then I start to get very frightened with shivering and fast breathing.

Did it happen to you? Do you know how I could do better? Is never engaging in anything REMOTELY controversial or funny an option?

This may be weird but I think my anxiety attacks start when I am prevented from a fight, like I wish to but I can't or am not allowed to. Why is that?

Fight means in most cases ""verbal argument"" or something, even though I would not step back from a fist fight if challenged, even though I would suck in it."

I weaned myself off sertraline and haven't taken it in almost a year. Alprazolam I haven't taken at all in months. Trazadone I remember sometimes, sometimes I don't. 

I'm also a type 1 diabetic. I've had a few major panic attacks since being diagnosed 5 years ago. No certain trigger, just come out of nowhere. Last new year's I had some strong chest pain, watched me overnight at hospital. Had stress test done with some anomalous things on the front of my heart. Had a cardiac catheterization done and everything was fine. 

For the first time in a long time I had an anxiety (I hope) issue last night. Went to bed about 9 o'clock, woke up at 10. Sweating, heart rate higher than normal, both arms tingling and my right foot tingling. Made sure blood sugar was good, took an alprazolam just in case. Watched TV for a bit and everything I was experiencing got worse. Started shaking a bit, tingling was worse, sweating any time I tried getting under a sheet. 

I never did experience any chest pain or arm pain. One or two times a had a pinch between my shoulder blades that was somewhat painful, but it only lasted a couple seconds at most. I believe that mainly stems from a posture problem anyway. I've been feeling drained all day today, never had that with other panic issues. I've also been colder today than usual. Working remotely but I've had a blanket on me all day. Very minimal appetite.

Is what I experienced any cause for alarm?"

Feeling lost and started getting anxiety attacks for the first time ever I was broken up with this past week by my girlfriend of 3.5 years. It was really sudden since we hadn't had any sort of discussion about breaking up before this and we had always been very close. Even on the day of I was only told that we were going to have a serious discussion. I think she chose to do it for my sake since she has been very busy with work and can't put a lot of effort into our relationship since we don't live together. We cried in bed together for 5 hours before I took her home. I still love her and I think she still loves me. Not only were we very attached to each other, but we were best friends as well. This woman is the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

After this I have been having waves of stress and anxiety because she wanted to go no contact until the beginning of June. I broke down yesterday during a big rush of stress and anxiety that I asked if we could meet sooner so I could speak my mind and give her my perspective to think about over the no contact period but then backtracked to respect her space. Today she responded that we will go no contact until mid to late june to let emotions settle. This gave me a big anxiety attack this morning I have been so used to talking to her everyday for anything and everything including support and now that I can't talk to her I'm really struggling. I have tried seeing and talking with friends but nothing has really helped. I just end up gaining confidence for a few hours only to have it shattered by anxiety attacks. It's gotten bad enough that I've hardly eaten, can get nauseous from seeing or smelling food, and have ended up losing about 4kg over the past 4 days. I'm also used to working out everyday and I've only just been able to do some working out today. It's even worse that my schedule is essentially empty with one shift of work per week. I have gotten 2 more shifts to help fill the time starting next week, but I still have 4 empty days. 

We are going to meet up to talk about our relationship after no contact ends, and it's giving me anxiety. My anxiety is always that nothing I say will fix the situation and I'll lose her forever. I find it harder to breathe and that my heart rate rises a bit. I also tear up too. I've never had this before and have no idea as to how I can get better. I was planning to build a life with her and now am feeling lost in life as well.

Does anyone have suggestions for what I could do to help while I wait for our no contact to end? I have considered therapy but I don't know what coverage I have and have just finished my undergrad and cannot afford it. (Found out that I got my degree the same day that we split. Such great timing.)"

We had so much in common, so many inside jokes and projects, and lately, we felt closer than ever: we had so much fun together and he was the most caring, lovely guy I've ever met. We're both huge geeks. Sex was great. I accepted him the way he was and showed unconditional love to him, even though our dates were sometimes ""stained"" by attacks. I didn't care: all I wanted was his well-being. Plus, we still had tons of fun together. **Still, I wasn't enough**. Still, he told me he was not falling for me and, although he didn't want to call it quits, he couldn't see how our relationship would progress, since **he was losing interest in me**. I don't know where I went wrong. I probably lowered my defences too soon. Seeing him being vulnerable while talking about his GAD made me think I could finally trust someone, and so I started to fall for him by the day. I'm so devastated. He made me believe that being vulnerable doesn't equal being flawed. He made me trust him. I probably didn't make him feel special enough, reassured enough, nothing enough. I don't know.

One of my very main problem is That I think a lot and I ruminate a lot and therefore this makes me think too much about things I shouldn't think about and increases my fears of fears and generates anxiety and panic attacks, but also fear To be alone.
This is because I love reading, drawing, and writing, and Unfortunately The creative process leads to the creation of many thoughts... Good and bad.
One thing is certain! I know how my brain works with my beliefs. For example, I'm afraid of the, plane but I'm sure if I took the plane once and I was fine, that's it, after Having had this positive experience, I have overcome the fear of flying, and I can take the plane many times.

2227,delayed_at_ewr,Needs A Hug/Support,4,Anxiety,1620851638,"At the suggestion of my therapist I saw a psychiatrist, and he made it seem like all I needed was a prescription from my PCP, not therapy or a psychiatrist. I've been seeing a therapist for about a month now (4 sessions) with the main goal of learning to deal with panic attacks when I fly. During the sessions we've also discussed some other things, stuff which personally I don't find too major (a few behaviors my therapist said suggested mild OCD and some mild daily anxiety that comes and goes). This prompted her to suggest me seeing a psychiatrist to see if I  should be on a daily medication or if they could give me something to take as needed. At first I didn't make an appointment, but after they suggested it the second time I did.


I had the appointment with the psychiatrist this afternoon and I'm so confused now. I went in to the appointment not really knowing what to expect. I knew that since they were both in the same practice he would have notes from my therapist, so that was good. He asked me some questions, which I answered honestly, a bit more honestly than the therapist, and at one point he said I was probably going to be his easiest patient all year. And I thought great! He'll give me whatever I need and I'll be done. But then throughout the rest of the conversation, which was very light-hearted, though serious when it needed to be, he said how talk therapy wasn't going to work for me. And that the only way to get over it was to fly. I told him that pre-pandemic I flew a lot, but it only got worse.  (With the exception of my first two panic attacks, my panic attacks only happen on planes). 


He said that generally this is an issue you go to your PCP for to get a ""tranquilizer"" and he asked why I hadn't gone that route. And I explained how going that route was exactly how I ended up in front of him. 


The appointment ended with him advising me to take Xanax, which I already have from my PCP, though I have yet to take, and saying ""Maybe I'm missing the point, in which case if I am when you come back from your trip we can start over."" 



I'm just kind of at a loss. I didn't go in looking for a diagnosis, but I also didn't expect a doctor to tell me that he didn't need to see me again because it would just be a waste of money for me. 


I have a flight coming up very, very soon, and I had been starting to wonder if the therapy and the work I've been doing was even working, and now I'm wondering even more. Like are all the physical symptoms I feel in my head? Should I really be seeing a therapist?



So I ask, how did you know when therapy was working for you? Also, how did you know if your therapist was the right fit for you? Personality wise, I think it's a perfect match for me, but lately I've been wondering if my therapist is truly capable of helping me."

My boyfriend of about one year (living together for 3 months) has struggled with anxiety for most of his life. I was diagnosed with social anxiety about 6 weeks ago. 

His anxiety is over surprises, or feeling like he‚Äôs left out of the loop. My anxiety is over conflict, people pleasing, etc. 

He has been really supportive, telling me he knows therapy is hard, he knows what anxiety feels like, he‚Äôs here for me, etc. I‚Äôve done my best to be there for him when he‚Äôs anxious too. 

But... when he‚Äôs anxious, he is blunt. He says things without thinking how they‚Äôll make me feel. He wants things done his way and my way is wrong. He asks me to do things that I‚Äôm not okay with. 

Him being anxious makes me anxious... when he‚Äôs blunt, I feel like I did something wrong even when I know I didn‚Äôt. I feel like I have to fix it even if it‚Äôs not my responsibility. I take on his anxiety and try to make it better, which makes mine worse. 

He‚Äôs said things many times like ‚Äúyou can always talk to me. Don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up if something bothers you.‚Äù It made me feel safe (I **really** struggle with this) and I told him about something in our relationship that bothered me.

I tried challenging myself, going out of my comfort zone even if it seems impossible and succeed. Staying productive and keeping myself busy. But lately I've regressed pretty bad and it has made me feel stagnant.   


My anxiety has been extremely overwhelming and my stress has been through the roof. Even basic interactions with my immediate family stress me out. I want to reach out to my cousins but I am not sure how to connect with them anymore. I get so stressed out with college that I put off all my work and don't even attend class because I am so afraid of failure. I don't even know what I am doing with my education anymore, I just take classes because the thought of advancing nowhere in life freaks me out. 

I love my girlfriend, I love my friends- but sometimes I feel like cutting them off because I feel like I don't even know how to be human anymore. I know they enjoy my company but my thoughts are intrusive and make me feel as if maybe they don't consider me their friend anymore. Sometimes I don't want to be friends because I don't want to see us grow apart. Even at work I don't really talk anymore because I am worried my coworkers do not like me.

Nothing really brings me joy anymore just because I am constantly tense- my mind is constantly racing with ""what I should be doing"" or ""the worst thing that could possibly happen"". Art used to be something that would ease my stress, but I can't even focus on what I am making anymore. All the music I listen too makes me even more stressed out or doesn't help at all. Video games just make me feel like I am wasting time. I'd say cleaning around the house is the most productive thing that helps but my anxiety still lingers there. 

If anyone could leave tips on how to make life a little less overwhelming I would be grateful. I just want to feel like I am getting back on the right track, because right now I feel like I tripped and have fell on my face."

While I was anxious, it actually went well. The man who administered my vaccination was very kind and reassuring. I was very proud of myself, and I didn‚Äôt feel any pain at all whatsoever.

The reason for this could be because I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast or something and had low blood sugar. I‚Äôm not sure.

2248,joobafob,Venting,1,Anxiety,1620845334,"It feels like I'm back to square one 4 years ago, my anxiety came back big time, and I've been slowly picking up the pieces since. Last year I ended up making huge progress. Unfortunately that progress was mostly due to a family tragedy. In late 2019, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, so I forced myself out of the house to be with her. It was such a painful ordeal, but it ended up helping me face my anxiety head on. She died just before Christmas that year, and while it initially sent me into a spiral of grief, it gave me the confidence to keep pushing even harder. I wanted to do it for her. I wanted something good to come out of it all. I ended up going from not being able to leave the house to going out for walks, doing the shopping, making appointments for myself, talking to people outside of my family. I had symptoms, but they were on the decline. Panic hadn't really been an issue for a while. For the past few months though, things have been slowly deteriorating. It started with a panic attack at home. Then one panic attack became another, and then another, until eventually a couple of weeks ago, I was hit with one in the middle of the supermarket. Since then, it's been every day. Leaving my room has become a challenge, and I've found that I no longer feel safe there either. I'm exhausted. I feel sick. I feel utterly broken. It feels like all of the progress I've made has just been obliterated. I've tried clinging on to my progress, forcing myself to go out and do the things I could before, but every time feels harder than the last with no improvement. It feels like I simply can't do those things any more, at least while I'm feeling this anxious all of the time. This isn't the first time I've had a set back, but it's been the biggest one yet, and I'm just starting to feel like Sisyphus.

Talking to people doesn't seem to help, since it feels like I'm either too anxious to even talk or they just don't understand, so I feel completely isolated and helpless. My parents offer the support they can, but I can't help but feel like I'm a disappointment. I'm 24, I dropped out of uni because of my anxiety, and I can't even do basic things and constantly rely on others for help. I haven't achieved anything and, while I still pay rent through my disability benefits, feel like I contribute nothing but pain. They're both retired now, and I'm holding them back. My younger brother has gone off to uni, and I'm still living with my them. When I'm not overwhelmed with anxiety, I'm wracked with guilt; the pain I cause me parents, my inability to live up to society's expectations, how I feel like I've failed my grandmother. If I weren't so afraid of death, I think I would consider suicide. I want to cry and I want to scream, and I just don't know what to do any more."

I decided to go to burger king, there was lots of people at the outside tables, since it was really sunny. I sat In the car for like 5minutes to muster up the courage, went in. No touchscreens. I had to go to the chasier, I stod Infront of the menu but I was so panicked that I could barely read it. I couldn't do it, gave up, went back to my car. Told myself I could go to McDonalds.

So went out, though I would give up, but remember that there's another hamburger place around the corner. Usually I would give up and go home and feel bad, but I decided that I had to  complete this task or it would become worse. I Went to the other place, and they had touchscreens, thank good. I was the only one at screen stations, when I stood there and tried to decide what to have, a guy came and poked my shoulder, He was really cute, and asked if I wanted his hamburger.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 22 (F) living with my 23 (M) bf for a couple months now in a studio. We recently been saving to move to a bigger apartment in a few months. However, the problem is, I‚Äôm bored and tired of every day life. I suffer from bad anxiety and depression and sometimes I just dream of going away to big city or moving across the country or world even. I know that these wishes aren‚Äôt necessarily practical but even if we took more vacations and did more spontaneous adventures, i think I‚Äôd be happy.
My boyfriend is very careful about saving for money (especially now). We have plans to get engaged by the end of this year and he knows I want a nice ring. We also have a vacation planned to NYC next month. But other than that, we  have no other major financial obligations (other than the usual like rent/food), and both have good full-time jobs with him making double what I do. I see all our friends getting married, taking lavish vacations, moving across the country, and I get ready jealous. I wish we could do all that but he says our priority right now is to move to a bigger place. While I don‚Äôt disagree with him, I do wish we could take more vacations and be spontaneous as I feel very unhappy with everyday life. He thinks we should be careful and save for our upcoming milestones.

Is there a compromise here? Am I being unfair or is he being too rigid?"

But at the same time, I've been feeling the need to make the transition to a new job for a while now, and have been more actively searching for a couple months.

What gets me though is scheduling phone calls and zoom meetings and constantly worrying about how to make it work with my existing schedule. This week alone, I've had three interviews already, all managed to be scheduled during my typical lunch time so it's less likely someone at work calls me.

But in a handful of weeks, if I haven't found the right job yet, I'm going to have to go back to trying to do interviews and search for jobs without the luxury and privacy of being at home. I've had recruiters call me all the time on my phone, which is fine, but if they did that at the office I'd have to go find a place to hide to answer their call and all that fun stuff.

Two things, though. One is that I know this process won't be forever, and at least I'm getting interviews. Two though, I know I could quit my job. I have plenty of savings to last a while, but my inner anxious self just doesn't compute the idea of throwing away financial stability. I can certainly schedule my interviews outside of office hours and keep playing this game of hiding the fact that I'm looking for a new job, so quitting to make it a little bit easier could bite me in the long run, or even make me settle on something that wouldn't be the right direction I want to move in.

Overall, I'm just writing this to express what I've been feeling lately. I've also been feeling depressed and unmotivated lately, so it's just all kind of layering on top of each other. But I feel fortunate in many other ways."

2266,grandprocrastinator,DAE Questions,0,Anxiety,1620839912,"Weird cold flashes that occur without hot flashes. Does anyone else experience something similar? Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been a bit curious about this because every time I‚Äôve looked into cold flashes, I‚Äôd keep finding information that describes them as occurring specifically after hot flashes, or relates them to menopause (and occasionally pre-menopause because hormones be wack sometimes). Sometimes they‚Äôre also linked to, or thought of as an overall sudden cold sensation and/or chills that pop up after getting anxious, but none of these seems to fit the description for my situation.

I‚Äôve had social anxiety for a couple of years, but the majority of the time, its tended to manifest in cold flashes. The more I‚Äôm around people, it becomes practically constant until I‚Äôm at home again. Even then, it usually doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äòturn off‚Äô, it takes a while for it to settle down. This usually feels almost like what I would describe as a wave-like ‚Äòsplash of cold water‚Äô within my back, but I‚Äôm also able to get it in practically any other part of my body. However, it‚Äôs quite selective in the sense that it isn‚Äôt an ‚Äòoverall‚Äô feeling of cold, these flashes usually happen in certain areas, or an area (ex. legs and back might feel a cold flash at once, sometimes it could just occur at one section like my legs, back, mouth, or arms/hands). It can trigger when I worry or obsess over it happening, and because of this, it has kind of spread over time as it would previously occur mostly in my back. 

I haven‚Äôt had a hot flash in a long time, yet these cold flashes alone result in garnering an unflattering amount of sweat (not quite sure how that works) and are just pretty long-lasting/frequent, particularly in social situations. In general it can trigger quite easily, but it doesn‚Äôt tend to happen when I‚Äôm chilling or busy at home. I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôve described is unusual or common for people with social anxiety disorder, but I haven‚Äôt seen any representations of cold flashes like this before (though it might simply be due to a lack of in-depth research on my end). This made me curious about whether others have experienced something similar. I‚Äôm interested in learning more about how different people feel cold flashes, and in what circumstances they take place for others. So, does anyone have flashes like these?

I am graduating college in a month. I secured a job in an excellent tech company just before my final year, that I will start immediately after graduation.

However, I feel very anxious and nervous that I won't be good enough for the company. My achievements and work ethics ( I did an internship so I have worked with them before) are good enough for the company. But I always feel like they will realise that I am not as smart as they think I am now, and they'll fire me. All of this before even starting the job.

I feel like I will be an impostor among my colleagues.

So I'm working from home due to covid (not really of my own choice) and I was supposed to provide the back end networking for a new copier on campus.  Anyway I gave the copier guy wrong info, but also he was trying to call me and I was trying to call him, and that was extremely frustrating because of phone problems which aren't my fault.  Anyway my supervisor had to get in the chain of communication, and then her supervisor and his backup because they were on site.  We worked out the mistake I made quickly, but then they ran into other issues.  It is working now.  I asked my supervisor's supervisor's backup how the mood was over there because I am imagining there are people over there who are mad at me.

I have only been in the particular location in which the copier was set up a few times over the past several years and I don't know any particulars.  One of the problems was that the people who work over there ""helpfully"" unplugged the old copier's network connection from the wall, rather than unplugging it from the copier and using it for the new one.

I tend to get really upset and freak out when stuff goes wrong like this.  My therapist asks me, what am I telling myself when that happens?  Well I am berating myself for not doing it perfectly, and I'm imagining all the people involved being outraged.  I thought about it and really, I think I am just subconsciously trying to steel myself for when I get ripped a new one for messing up.  The thing is, that has never really happened at my current job, but it was a constant thing at my old job.  And usually, the reason things went badly at the old job is because my boss/the company owner had ridiculously unreasonable expectations.  I say that, but I still blame myself.  Even though I saw about 10 people come and go in about 10 years there.  Most didn't last a year, and most just walked out the door as the boss was yelling at them, and never came back.

So, I only got one dressing down at my current job, in the 7 years I have been here, and it wasn't very severe, but I can't stop thinking about how I'm going to get in trouble, or worrying about it.  It doesn't help that since I am working from home, it's mostly on the honor system that I'm even doing anything.  I do, but after a year plus, I do tend to relax a bit and I was actually making breakfast when the problem occurred.

2272,cab1120,Needs A Hug/Support,1,Anxiety,1620837085,"Help working through insurance/mental health issues Hi everyone... I'm not even sure if this is the right place for this, but I just don't know what to do and I need to get this all out of my system because I'm currently having a panic attack at work. I currently live in NC and I was seeing a therapist and a psychologist. I was diagnosed with OCD, general panic, and general anxiety disorders stemming from the death of my aunt last year. I have had panic attacks and I get stressed very easily. I am on two medications to help with these.

We are now moving to Utah so I won't have insurance for my medications for two months while we start new jobs. I also quit my therapy and continuous meetings with my psychologist because Aetna stopped covering for virtual mental health appointments so it was over $100 per session. I also was never a fan of my psychiatrist or the office and I was too anxious about finding another so I stuck with her.

I'm trying to figure out a new way to see a therapist/psychiatrist that is more affordable but my current insurance is useless and they just said if I see a mental health specialist through Teledoc, it could be anywhere from $80-$190 a session... with that must uncertainty in price, I don't feel comfortable doing it. I have no idea what to do because my husband and I really felt like the therapy was helping me but I can't afford to do that per session, especially if I'm seeing a psychiatrist as well.

Another issue is that because I'll be off my medications for multiple months, I wanted to get my animals (dog and cat) ESA certified so they can live with me wherever we move because they do help with my panic attacks and stress. My therapist even agreed that they should be but my current psychiatrist's office will not write a recommendation letter for me and are zero help in helping me figure out how to get it done. I also just learned that to get a single copy of my records from them in order to change doctors, I would have to pay $50. I have never had to pay for medical records if I only get them once so I feel like I will have to start completely over with someone else... which may not be a bad thing but I still wanted to be able to show that I have been diagnosed with these issues.

There is just a lot of uncertainty with how I will get to afford therapy/psychiatrist and I don't know where to turn to get my animals certified and I am just so stressed about this. To just make matters better, I think I have given myself stomach ulcers but I HATE dealing with my insurance enough that I don't want to try to find a physician that isn't urgent care to look into this before we move in a month and half.

I just feel hopeless and stressed and I have no idea what to do. I'm driving my poor husband crazy because he just wants to help and here I am having my panic attacks and stressing over everything.

Thank you for taking the time to read my ramblings. I have had this bottled up for weeks and I just needed to get it all out. Maybe someone can help me."

I've got no friends and the people that I sit next to in my class always make fun of me for not understanding the work or for not getting a question correct.

One day I got bullied soo much, I came home crying, went to my room with a knife, held the knife to my own head and was thinking about ending my life. That's until my mum came bursting into my room because she could hear me crying, she comforted me and made me feel like I belong in this world and that everything would get better.

Since then, the bullies have got permanently excluded (expelled). I left the school and moved to London with my family. I've settled in to a good school, and amazing friends. I am now living a happy life. My grades in school are still really low, but I'm working extra hard to get them up.

And I hate having anxiety. It's gotten so much worse this past year and a half. . . I'm starting to have major embarrassment issues. Like, I'm embarrassed of myself entirely at this point.

I just had an interaction that sent me into a shame spiral and I'm still recovering.

I was talking to someone when I said something that was taken in a way I didn't mean it, a suggestive way and I didn't know what to do. When they brought it up I couldn't verbalize that they had misunderstood me so I ended up laughing it off. BUT I COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT !

A lot of the time I'm in 'auto pilot'. Does anyone else feel that way with their anxiety ? It's like I have a catalogue of responses in my mind and I just cycle through them. And sometimes they don't fit the situation and I feel so ashamed.

That's kind of what happened in this instance.

After freaking out about it, shovelling three chocolates down my throat I decided to confront the person to whom I said the thing and explain myself. It wasn't easy. I was stood waiting for them, pressing my thumb against my teeth and shaking. And I spoke so frantically and fast I'm sure I broke some kind of world record, but I think they understood me. . .

Usually when this sort of stuff happens I try to move on and avoid it, push it away like it never happened, but I always end up obsessing over it and I feel like crap.

I'm still feeling quite ashamed but I do feel better that I at least tried. 

So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if the moment has passed and the last thing you want to do is to dig it all back up, endeavouring to clear things up interrupts those negative thought processes and helps A LOT. And eventually the shame will dissipate.

I think I've always suffered from anxiety, though when I was younger it was more of a social anxiety than anything. As I got older, I think it manifested into health anxiety, but I didn't realize that's what it was until about 6 months ago. 

My anxiety had been bad since June of last year (after an actual medical diagnosis that is now, hopefully, under control), but again, I didn't know it was health anxiety until I had a GI doctor tell me I should talk to a therapist and go on medication for my health anxiety (this was November of last year).

After a rough time with the start of my medication, and then therapy, I finally got to a spot where I wasn't scared of every sensation my body did. My GI symptoms mostly didn't bother me anymore (though I still had them), and I was able to recognize my thoughts as anxiety, and was a lot more able to acknowledge them and move on.

But now, I'm not sure what happened exactly? I don't really *feel* anxious, but, I'm pretty sure I'm going through a set back, considering I've messaged my GI doctor and pretty much told her I want these tests run that she didn't run before because she felt I was too young (I'm 38 now, female). And now, out of nowhere, I'm researching something that is incredibly rare, almost convinced I might have it and trying to talk myself out of calling my doctor to run these *other* tests. Sigh. 

But I don't feel anxious? It's such a weird feeling... But I obviously am, because my hot face/cold hands and feet are back, and I can't sit still. Or stay off Google (I know, I know, Google is the enemy. Again. I was doing so good at staying off Google), and constantly checking subs like AskDocs.

I was on the Health Anxiety sub for a while, but it seems to have changed recently? There are very few posts a day now, it seems, I think rules have changed or something. But, I don't really go there anymore now.

 I am quite honestly at my wits end here and would appreciate some advice from others who understand how this feels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any time I enter a romantic relationship with anyone I care about my anxiety skyrockets and does \*not\* stop until that relationship ends, even if it is a 2+ year long relationship. I am just as anxious as day 1. My adrenaline glands do not stop going, preventing me from eating or really focusing on anything else, so I can't even distract myself from my thoughts. All my brain does is obsess over every little thing that could go wrong in the future and even if my partner is reassuring and supportive it does absolutely nothing to stop it. Their words mean nothing. My brain will physically not stop thinking about all of the fears and insecurities I have to the point of self sabotage. Like it almost feels like my brain is tingling when I get anxious meaning I can't even try to reframe my thoughts because even if my thoughts cool down that physical sensation remains which reignites the negative thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weird thing is I have been going to therapy for over a year now to talk about this stuff and my therapist has given me nice tools to help but my physical reaction to the anxiety is so so so powerful that once the anxiety gets bad there is absolutely nothing stopping it. It's not even the thoughts I am scared of at this point, it's my bodies reaction to them. My face gets hot, my vision feels like its narrowing, there is a tingling in my ears and this happens \*multiple\* times a day. I have met the most amazing guy (I am also a guy idk if that changes the perspective of this) who is so nice to me but he has a busy work schedule so in the time away I just sit here about to vomit and wonder if his phrasing in his last text means he doesn't like me anymore. Even if he says something nice, within realistically...let's say...2 minutes? I am back to being a physical wreck. Its so discouraging putting in so much effort and going to therapy WEEKLY for over a year and my   
 physical responses have made no progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to you all is: How normal is a response this bad? How do you guys cope with the physical sensation of it all? Because once I start losing weight it makes my anxiety even worse.

2303,astradeu,Venting,1,Anxiety,1625579275,"I'm so exhausted from all the anxiety attacks I needed to vent somewhere safe and I found this sub here. I usually would describe myself as someone who's always on the edge. I'm going out with my friends? I get anxious even though it's supposed to be a relaxing situation and they make me feel safe and there's no judgement whatsoever. I'm always anxious and always stressing out. 

However, college elevates this to a whole new level. I'm in a fairly hard major and professors expect us to be studying 24/7, and I do obviously, but staring at my computer for hours and hours really starts stressing me out and I'm always grinding my teeth and shaking throughout the day from overthinking if everything is going to turn out fine. Lately, I've even been cutting my hair(constantly, the scissors are always somewhere near me) and scratching my head until it bleeds from how stressed out I am. Now, I usually get good grades and my hard work pays off for the most part but last semester, I failed my first class. I knew I'd fail because during the exam, I started panicking and forgot everything I had been studying for the entire semester. I took it again this semester, and I actually just finished its exam about 2 hours ago, I thought I did pretty good and I was definitely passing this time. My friend called me an hour ago and tells me he had trouble on one question and suddenly I get an anxiety attack. What if I did not answer anything right on the exam and fail again? My heart started pounding, I lost control of my body and it felt like I was about to pass out. This is a common thing that's been happening this semester unfortunately. Almost every night since April has been like this for me. I get an anxiety attack, and it feels like the entire world is spinning and I'm gonna faint. I also have a feeling I might fail another class again and it's keeping me from sleeping well at night. I don't wanna drop out because I love this major so much and it's the only thing that I wanna do but my mental health is deteriorating and I'm just tired. I don't even think my grades are gonna come out until August and I don't know if I can go a whole month with nightly anxiety attacks. Sometimes I just wanna tell my parents what I feel, or that I failed a class, but I'm scared of telling them and I don't even know why. I wanna say I want someone to hug me and tell me it's okay but honestly I always feel like it just leaves me more alone. Yes, you hugged me and you care for me, but at the end, it's me and my thoughts again."

I have constant anxiety, like what I experienced intermittently at nursing school, but constant. I used to be a ‚Äúpeople person‚Äù, but now I get so nervous meeting new people. And this past weekend, the fireworks just sent me over the edge. I went to a party a friend was having. Pretty big party. I usually help, and then schmooze with the people I don‚Äôt know, and then help with the fireworks. 
This time, I had to leave the party to get away from everything. And then when it was time for the fireworks, I was walking over to help, then just noped out of there and could barely watch them from inside and the noise set me on edge like never before.

He has mental issues, drug issues. He has been a friend since high school. Known him 15 years nearly. He lost him mom and lost the plot ever since. He comes and goes, changes his phone a lot, etc. Anyway, he takes things like crack cocaine, lost most his teeth, blah blah.

He has a kind side to him, he has done kind things to me in the past, like he had a lump sum and even purchased things for my car some years ago. He will buy me a coffee if he has money (which isn‚Äôt often as he spends it impulsively when he has it), I‚Äôll treat him also.

However, although he is homeless and has been put up in hotels, I know he likes to take drugs. He asks me at times (Can I lend ¬£20 for \*excuse\*, I am sure it is because he is desperate for a drug). However, I also know he is homeless and is been put up on hotels, and then often eventually kicked out for one reason or another ‚Äì Zzzz.

So recently I did lend him ¬£20 and he said he would give it back the next day and pay it in my account. Of course, I am not na√Øve and so I didn‚Äôt expect it for sometime. However, 5 weeks on he hasn‚Äôt been in touch other than once again he sent a text saying he was on the street. I just ignored that and said he still owes me ¬£20 and had not been in touch. He rarely goes on Facebook, but I messaged him to say when does he want to meet up and has, he got the ¬£20 and had they found him a place to live. He eventually logged on the other day and did see it but didn‚Äôt reply. AHHHH!!? His crazy partner, who fancies me, and is jealous of me as I got house, business, car, etc. She asked how I was, which was nice. I did then ask if they‚Äôd found a new place from the government, but she didn‚Äôt reply to that. Confused?!?

I do not got other mates (my job makes it near impossible, and I got anxiety and can't make new friends), It annoys me so much. What should I do? I feel like telling him to go away, but that would be a bad move I think ‚òπI am not in his situation with no home and drug addiction‚Ä¶ so ideas people? It is playing on my mind and putting me in a seriously negative mood ‚Äì friends are supposed to meet up somewhat regular, not be ignored for 5 weeks!"

recently i've been in lockdown (in australia) and as ive been quite bored with nothing to do, intrusive thoughts and anxiety have been really severe recently. Throw in a relationship breakdown a few months ago i cant seem to move on from, and a career fork in the road, and its just been really mentally draining.

My question is not for strategies to move on, get help - i know what to do but i cant do anything right now stuck inside, so more about cognitive reframing and the choices i can make.

When i get intrusive thoughts, do i brush them off/laugh them off or do i embrace them, sit down and think them out until im desensitised to them? I've tried both but i dont want to commit to either until i know what it will achieve.

TW: intrusive thoughts, suicidal thoughts, selfharm

Hello, I'm first time poster so I hope my post is alright. I'm on my mobile so sorry for the formatting and also I'm not a native English speaker so sorry for any mistakes. 

I'm F 24, I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few years ago, I was going to the psychiatrist but stopped after 2 years because she decided I hadn't needed help anymore. 

In the last few months my anxiety got worse. It has gotten to a point I think I'm gonna pass out during the attacks, I'm weak and I can barely stand. My hands and fingers curls and I clench my fists so bad that my nails cut into palms. I also puke sometimes. My thoughts run through my head, I zone out and I want to dissapear. I have a lot of sucidal thoughts, I just want to end it all. I scratch my face, my arms, neck but it's like I don't completely control myself in that times.

I'm worried because I have panic attacks almost every day and I've gotten suicidal because I just can't stand this and life in general anymore.

I found out that my triggers are when I think people are going to leave me, when I feel like they're tired of me and when I feel like they don't care about me (especially my boyfriend) - and I feel like that almost every second of the day. I'm also anxious about future, this pandemic, my job and the fact that I'm getting older.

I'm so tired and I know we all are. I just feel so alone because nobody understands. I tried explaining it to my boyfriend but he doesn't know what to do. My friends have other problems and I feel like they don't care.

I have run out of the ideas what I should do."

I‚Äôve ‚Äúgot myself‚Äù into working overtime numerous times, doing tasks, which are not my responsibility, taking other people‚Äôs tasks, because they can‚Äôt complete them on time, etc. 

As I said, I‚Äôve always been like this, but the problem became so much worse at my first job, which I started about an year ago. The working environment was really toxic.

2315,Ok-Restaurant-9356,Helpful Tips!,2,Anxiety,1625574522,"My healing process I would like to share my routine for healing from anxiety totally. English is not my native language, so i can make faults.

 I had massive anxiety that ruined my life. I was agitated 7/24 and i couldnt have one normal conversation with people. I've become unable to do normal things. Even eating, toilet and shower was hell for me. And i couldnt have good sleep for months. Now i am %80 better. I have a long history with medications and doctors. I stop using medications like 2 year before i started this routine.

 I didnt use and medication in this period and i dont recommend you to stop using it. This is not proven scientificly, so do not ask me my sources. I tried and it worked for me, you can try and see if it will work. 

 1. I tried to give my body rest. I did intermittent fasting with 2 meals, 16/8,  sometimes with 1 snack between. I overchewed the food to the point it becames liquid(Important). I did this for help my digestion. You can change to 3 meals a day after sometime. But i think you should wait minimum 4 hours for another meal. I dont reccoment snack if you eat 3 or 3+ meals a day. Try to make your body comfortable.

I dont need to talk about sleep. You know. If you wake up fatigue after all the things you tried, check sleep apnea.

2. Streching is mandatory. 10 minutes everyday. . If you can, i recommend lifting weights. But dont stop streching.

3. Do not take your phone with you when you go to toilet or shower. 

4. Most important one. No music. Do not use your earphones. At all. 

I recommend you not to listen music at all for 3-4 days. Then start listening 1 hours a day, just do not listen all the time. Give your mind rest. I give myself from 30 minutes to 1 hours at nights for listening. """"And when you listen, do not use earphones."""" Sometimes, i dont listen at all. My goal is to not allowing random words, melodies, informations etc. to enter my mind 7/24. When i listen music, i dont open random playlist and let it fill my mind. I know exacly what i will listen. The genre, informations etc. No depressive music.

5. I dont let all the information to enter my mind. Same with music, i just dont enter instagram or twitter or facebook and starting reading random things, seeing random photos, random information all the time. I think and decide what i want to enter my mind, then i do that thing.

I dont recommend you to use social media. First 3-4 days at all. Then, post a photo or look for the photos your friends posted and leave. Do not lose yourself in random informations. I dont recommend you to follow pages. If there is pages you really like, keep following them and unfollow the rest. You can check this pages when you want. Just do not look this pages when you randomly surfing on instagram,twitter etc. You will open the page when you want.

6. I dont meditate because my routines is like meditating all the time. When you dont listen music and lose yourself in random informations, your mind is almost clear all the time. If you like, im sure it will help you. You can meditate to. I think minimum 10 minutes will work.

 This is what i did for my anxiety and it cured it almost %80. This is not medical advice, do not stop using you medication.

 If you try and if it works for you, let me know."

2324,shroomie_xo,Trigger Warning,1,Anxiety,1625571486,"Fingers Crossed for medication/CBT combination treatment? Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is relevant to post here - I've suffered with anxiety on and off my whole life, but in the past 1.5/2 years it has steadily got worse and worse. I went through a highly traumatic situation about 2 years ago and despite going to counselling to try and overcome it, there was obviously deeper rooted issues that were festering in the background. 

Around 2 months ago it had gotten so bad that I was physically ill &amp; couldn't keep any food down, resulting in unhealthy weight loss and having no energy. Because I was throwing up multiple times a day, I couldn't go to work/leave my house/do anything except lie in bed, starving. This then progressed to being completely unable to sleep, which presumably played on my brain because I started having horrific night terrors every night to the extent that I was then \*afraid\* to try and sleep. I'm a 26 year old woman and I repeatedly had to go into my mom in the middle of the night in floods of tears, to ask if I could sleep in her bed. The lack of sleep eventually resulted in me actually believing there was something in my room that was watching me &amp; waiting for me to sleep and I couldn't so much as close my eyes without feeling a panic attack coming on. If I did manage to sleep I'd either wake up screaming or \*feeling\* like I was screaming, from trying to wake myself up to get out of the dream.

Eventually I really felt I was on the verge of some sort of mental breakdown - my brain wasn't functioning at all, I was having awful intrusive thoughts all day everyday, and the anxiety was the only thing that I could focus on. Thankfully I had the sense to finally go to the doctor and I just sat in this lovely doctor's office for an hour crying and spilling out a mess of what was wrong with me. Fair play to her for being able to make sense of any of it because I think it was just a jumble of feelings and tears.

After a few tests/health checks &amp; a lot of discussion on what the best course of action would be, she prescribed anti-depressants that are also meant to help combat anxiety, to try and stabilize me and at the very least fix the sleeping pattern so everything else isn't so impossible to deal with. Feeling a  little more stable in that sense now, I'm due to start cognitive behavioral therapy with a psychiatrist she referred me to and honestly I am so hopeful. I've done a lot of research online and I feel like it could really be helpful, as I just have gone so long now without being able to cope with anything in my life at all. I just bury my head in the sand and hope it will go away and I presume this is what has brought me to the situation I'm in now. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone down the medication teamed with CBT route here and how did you find it helped? I know they say you get out what you put in; I just have a good feeling because for the first time in years I feel like I'm doing something that will let me live my life and stop hiding in fear. I feel like I've wasted so much time and missed out on so much, and this could be the first step to ending the cycle. 

Thanks all &lt;3"

I dont think I'm alone when saying I look for total, uncompromised freedom from anxiety. Some magic wand will show up one day and whoosh it all away. But I realised this morning, that there is no final end to negativity and triggers in life. We can only get better at dealing with it.  

Ironically there was a peace in realising I will never be 100% free. Acceptance I guess. But the peace came from realising I CAN get stronger every day until I have some control over it rather than it having total control over me.

Also, loosing the despondency of 'not winning today'. The smallest steps make tomorrow that much better. And the next day. There is no next day delivery on this. Anxiety doesn't bow culture of immediacy.

I met my girlfriend in the evening and that helped, however I‚Äôm back at work and I can feel those feelings creeping back up and I‚Äôm terrified.

I don‚Äôt know how I can get through the week feeling like this.

Any suggestions?"

For a few months now, I have been experiencing a sensation that feels like sunburn in certain parts of my body (tops of feet, buttocks, neck, face). The sensations come and go but they are there every day. My dermatologist ran blood tests and can't find anything wrong.

Often there is no visible sign, but sometimes there is some blotchy redness. It's causing me a lot of distress - it's uncomfortable to walk or sit sometimes, and other times my feet burn so much I can't get to sleep at night.

2345,liferollson520,Medication,1,Anxiety,1625560347,"How did you get prescribed 2mg bars of Xanax? Is your anxiety that crippling? It‚Äôs from my understanding that most psychiatrists usually start at .25-.5mg of Xanax for anxiety as a therapeutic dose. I‚Äôve read that a lot of doctors steer away from prescribing 1-2mg due to the benzo being highly addictive and abused. 

When I was in the hospital in December due to crisis, they started me off with .5 Ativans for anxiety but that was way too short acting. The psychiatrist then tried Xanax .25 &amp; .5 which worked for a little but I still got anxiety once it wore off and honestly, I didn‚Äôt really feel anything from it. The next benzo I was prescribed was 5mg of Valium which seemed to work for me. It wasn‚Äôt too strong where I was dysfunctional, didn‚Äôt make me tired, but somehow relieved my anxiety and panic attacks.

Now my question is to those of you who are prescribed 2mg Xanax a day (sometimes x3 a day from what I read), how did you get your doctor to prescribe you that high of a dose? Is your anxiety that bad? I can imagine it was hard to do as many doctors are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and will only want to prescribe .5mg of Xanax as the maximum from personal experience and reading up online."

I'm in the UK, I have severe anxiety (which I hide well enough) and have been working part-time in a shop since October, after I finished my undergrad last summer. It was always the plan to do something temporary this year, as I'm starting my masters in September. I'm working part-time 1) for health/personal reasons and 2) to take a break and because of everything going on with COVID. They don't know I'm planning to go.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I plan to leave in August, so have to give a month's notice soon. I'm absolutely terrified of handing it in. My managers absolutely suck, they are so belittling and and I don't think I've ever had an open, relaxed conversation with any of them. I've called in sick one time in the last 9 months which I later explained was because of fear that I had COVID symptoms, and they basically didn't care at all (""well, you don't have symptoms, do you?"") and told me they expected me to be in. The air was never cleared and I never trusted them after that. I almost left then and there but I needed the money. The environment is gossipy and catty, and I've felt like I've had to tell white lies about my life to everyone because there's no way I can just \~be myself\~. And it's not just me; everyone agrees the management is awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I know five (!) other people who will have left between now and September for various reasons, so I logically know my leaving is really going to mean next to nothing. However, because of our strained relationship and the fact they have no inclination that I'm going back to uni at all, the thought of initiating that conversation is making me extremely nervous.

2357,mbrckyrc,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1625554745,"Looking for help. I keep failing at everything. I have the feeling that the good life is not meant for me?  I have this awful habit of thinking that I am cursed to never get what I want. Am I depressed because I have the wrong attitude that keeps me from getting what I want ? I do want to label my depression as bad luck. I would like to take responsibility and continue working on myself if I only knew what I am doing wrong. If anyone had a similar experience and managed to escape from constant failure I would like to know what you did. In order to explain what is going on I need to tell a very long story.

I am 27 years old and I live in the Netherlands. Have always had a sense of dread looming over me. As a child I had an abusive dad who did not allow me to have negative emotions since he did not want to take responsibility for anything. Got severely bullied at school and beaten at home, for no good reason. I kept moving more than 10 times, was even homeless for a while and never got to develop social skills as a child. Physical and mental pain was the only thing I knew. And I always believed it was my fault when I got beaten. One time I burned my hand while cooking and my father got angry, beat me and kicked me out of the house without given me a chance to put cool water on it, it was even a Sunday so the doctor's office was closed. I had to do everything myself and if I got any kind of personal problems I received tantrums instead of help (like when I burned my hand). A therapist concluded that I was a neglected child. In high school I managed to get some friends but no friend group, I was people's left over acquaintance. I did not my mind since for the first time I had friends even though I rarely got invited for anything and some treated my really bad but I did not know better, I assumed this was the best I deserve. In high school I was a terrible student, did not know why but I used my time their as a place to get fun since I couldn't get it at home. Still had to do everything myself, learning to ride a bike, learning to shave, did not know how to study or prepare things. In high school I was still severely depressed since I still lived on egg shells and still got bullied and beaten at home for nothing. Often got long speeches from my father how I have a despicable character. Took me long time to realize that my treatment at home was not my fault and I did not deserve it (was around 24 when I realized that). Never got any recognition that I did my high school well even though I barely had elementary school and a reading disability due to the lack of school as a child. At 15 years old for the first time in my life two friends wanted to drop by at my birthday but my sibling didn't want it since ""we don't do those things"" while he had a large group of friends. He is still friends with them after more than a decade. This developed into a crooked world view, if I saw an ad at school or any opportunity for something fun I assumed in my subconscious I was not the target audience. This I did until I was 25.

After high school I managed to get into the top university of my country. Finally lived on my own at 19 years old, my parents didn't even bother asking where I lived. Could barely afford it, asked my parents for some money sometimes, just enough to buy minimal groceries, did not eat warm every day since I did not want to bother them. Still had the attitude that good things are not meant for me and stayed depressed and lonely. Dropped out of school since my depression kept me from studying. And here is where I changed my world view even though it still took years to realize it. I went back to the same university since I was desperate for a better life. Nothing changed.... I did not eat any junk food, went to the gym, became extremely disciplined, overcame a masturbation addiction that crippled my energy levels, worked several nights a week. I still believed that the good things in life weren't meant for me. All my hard work was fuelled by the fear that my life would always be filled with despair. I managed to graduate with a master and learned to be social. I became more and more confident in my abilities and learned to be extroverted and daring.

But still I tried to connect with people but kept failing. I had a good friendships but as soon that person did not needed my help I get ignored. If I invite people to do things I hardly get a response at all. I only talk with people if I start the conversation. I tried to get dates since I was finally confident in my looks after all the time spent in gyms and failed. I was labelled by a female roommate as one of the nicest person they ever met so I assumed there should at least be one person that likes me back. Now I am trying to get a job but have been living in someone's attic for a year with no social contacts and no success and the idea that good things are not meant for me is back. I graduated in a STEM field from a good university with a skillset that is supposed to be desirable by employers, my peers immediately got jobs and I can't even get to live on my own. Past year has been a void of despair. Worst year in my life so far. I keep getting more disciplined and engaged to get to the next level but things only get worse.

I keep asking how much work do I need to do to get at least something in return? I keep looking at other people's lives (bad habit I know). How even things that would change my entire live comes so easy to them. Like having someone text them, show interest in them, getting a job, being loved by anyone, having a home etc. My therapist told me that I am too demanding on myself but I do not know what else to do besides looking inward. I no longer go to therapy since the therapist moved and I was actually treated for an anxiety disorder (hypochondria) caused by my childhood which I overcame. I can only work on myself not on others. Even after all this if I knew a direction to get out of my endless despair I would do everything I can to go there but I am at a loss. I tried really hard and I am still at the same mental place where I was as a teen or child. Just me alone watching other people's lives and day dreaming all day since I have nothing else to do..... as usual."

So I saw a therapist for about six weeks, and I am no longer seeing her. I was never, and will never, be a danger to myself or anyone else.

Since my therapist decided to cancel abruptly, because sessions weren't seen as beneficial for me, I did not like how they handled ending my sessions without any closure.

Over email, I vaguely mentioned to the therapist that I could escalate this with a lawyer if i have to, and a few days later I received an email saying that I was ""threatening"" my therapist legally, and they gave me a number of their own attorney to call for any questions.

Would this in turn give them legal justification to break confidentiality? Like in the sense that ""threatening"" them legally would mean that I was a danger to them?

The only legal reason to break confidentiality is if I'm a danger to myself or anyone else... could me threatening them legally be considered me being a danger to someone?

Someone said that if i threaten to sue a medical provider, that my confidentiality can be broken by my therapist.... does this apply here? Is my confidentiality maintained between my therapist and myself?"

My girlfriend and i have been dating since we were in school and more than 3 years have passed. She has been suffering and struggling to deal with anxiety for more than a year now. We've gone through many unpleasant stages during the process and i don't think it's getting any better. 

Backstory - It all happened when we were studying in college together in another state and she got really sick. I had to see her suffer so much and thought I'd lose her. She had no choice but to go back to our hometown and by God's grace, she got better. But something had changed. She started having panic attacks and extreme mood swings regularly and at first I couldn't understand what was happening to her and neither did she. We struggled for sometime but she finally discovered that it was anxiety and it has never really left her since it began about a year and a half ago. 

We're both back home now. After all these months of struggling with her more or less, yes, it has improved a bit and she has learnt to control it a little, but it always seems to come back stronger. It comes in the form of loneliness, anger, nostalgia, panic attacks and more. Now understand that I've never left her alone or given up on her despite all this but seeing her feel lonely despite me being there for her hurts a lot. I guess me saying I'm there for her is a bit far-fetched though since i haven't been able to meet her for about two months now because of covid second wave. 

She tries to break up or distance herself from me when her anxiety come back and idk what to do. She says there's no point in talking when i don't even know what to say. What am i supposed to say to make her feel better? I tell her I'll come meet her as soon as the lockdown ends. I tell her I'm here for her and she can call me whenever she wants, even late at night and I'll always pick up. Similar situation happened last year as well when covid first hit and we weren't able to meet for about six months. 

She has even tried talking to other guys during this period and this is the part that hurts the most. I feel like I'm not doing enough or the right things to keep her happy and she's gonna leave. She has distanced herself from me again saying she has a lot of pent up anger and it needs to be dealt with and she'll deal with it alone. It's been almost a week. We talk, but not like we did before. She's still not getting much better and it's killing me. 

What should i do? Should I just let her be or do something? Should i try to talk to her about consulting a psychologist? I've read a lot about anxiety and i still don't know what to do. I feel like an idiot. I love her so much. We've been through so much together and we've always come out fighting but this time, i feel like we're losing. I miss her but i don't want to bother her when she's not alright to talk. It drains her. Maybe it's just talking to me that drains her, idk."

I have anxiety about most things. I constantly doubt myself. Am I worthy enough? Smart enough? Cool enough? Did I make the right call? Sure enough? It takes me forever to make decisions and when I finally do, I often feel like I've made the wrong choice. I also have a knack for sabotage. Things on my mind right now: 

1. I started a new job and feel like I took ""fake it til you make it"" too far. I'm afraid I don't know what the hell I'm going? Hoping it just imposter syndrome or perfectionism or both. 
2. With said job, I am happy with my salary but fear I didn't negotiate as I should have. Now I've messed up my potential income for the next few years. 
3. I feel unwanted. I don't know if I am ready to be wanted but it still hurts. None of the romantic connections in my life want me like I want them or how I want them to want me.
4. I keep letting myself down. I wasted the day instead of working on the assignment that I am worried about. I tried to do a workout to get some positive energy going. Stopped that 15 minutes through.
5. I keep letting others down. I can't maintain relationships the way I want to. I feel like I'm not there for people the way I want to be. 

On the outside I am fun, social, and professionally successful. But in my head, and especially when I'm alone, I am tearing myself apart.

2393,kouki8862,Needs A Hug/Support,2,Anxiety,1625540943,"Need help with my Anxiety. Long detailed post. On March 29th 2021, I woke up at 1AM by what felt like either someone punched me in the stomach or I was choking. My heart rate was up and I was hyperventilating, thinking that I was experiencing a heart attack. I rushed to the bathroom to try to calm down and decided to google my symptoms. Worst thing to do. I was convinced it was a heart attack and rushed to the hospital. Doctors tell me I was having a heart attack. 

A little background on what I believe led to my panic attack: 

- I was prescribed trazadone in October of tbe previous year due to insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking of work. It helped tremendously. 

- I was under intense stress at work with 2 projects due by the end of March. One which I finished on the same day of my panic attack, which made me feel super alleviated. It confuses me thinking that this might have contributed to my panic attack. I do recall that my stress levels would get so bad that my eyesight would get blurry and I would feel dizzy sometimes. I would stop doing my work and go outside for a breather. 

- I was closing on a home at the end of the month. I was worried about losing my job and not being able to close on the home. 

- Found out we were having a kid a week or two before. 

- Tried an edible for the first time 2 weeks prior. Worst experience ever. Convinced I was dying. I felt fine the day after but I do recall memories from hat experience during my panic attack. 

After my panic attack, I was in the process of moving the next three days. I was terrified of sleeping, thinking it would occur again. I was afraid of being a couch potato so I would force myself to get up and get on with the move. I called in for work because I felt like I wasn't going to be productive in the mental state I was in. Tunnel vision. Foggy mind. Feeling anxious or I guess the adrenaline you produce from your Sympathatic Nervous System. 
The fogginess and tunnel vision went away after the 3 days but the high alert feeling wouldn't go away. 

I was prescribed hydroxyzine and it made me feel worse. The feeling of being forced to slow down made me even more anxious. I was later then prescribed with buspirone. It helped during the day, but at night I was restless. It would keep me awake and sometimes cause anxiety. I continued for 2 weeks and one day I woke up, feeling normal... I was shocked and decided to stop taking it. But after a day or two, my anxiety or i would say HEALTH anxiety came back. 

During this whole ordeal, I was worried about my health. My stomach hurt that night I had my panic attack so I convinced myself that I had an intestinal issue. I had symptoms of heart burn, loose stools, acid reflux, knot in throat, and excess salivation. 

Doctor prescribed me omeprazole 40mg because 20mg was doing nothing. It helped kinda but I would still get acid reflux here and there if I didn't watch what I eat. Keep in mind, I rarely eat fast food or drink soda. Usually cooked at home and exercised 3 or 4 times a week. Weight lifting wise. I decided to get an endoscopy and they found nothing. I stopped taking the omeprazole and i was fine for 3 weeks. I eased back into my normal diet during those 3 weeks. I went on a trip for a week and ate like shit and my stomach symptoms came back. I was feeling anxious throughout my whole trip, always convinced that I had health issues when I felt bodily sensations such as head pulsation, aching, tingling, etc. 

After my trip, I decided to see a counselor. I shared my experienced and he helped with my negative thoughts when I would feel physical symptoms. He wants to dig deeper thinking that a childhood trauma or other experience is what caused my panic attack but I'm pretty sure it was my work and life events I had going on. 

So that's where I'm at now and need some help or advise or if you guys/gals can provide your experience to help with my though process. 

- I still think something is wrong with my health. I'm so convinced of it and even got on omeprazole again because of my stomach symptoms. 

- I keep myself so busy after work because if I slow down, I think I'm gonna die. When I relax, I think I'm gonna die. I also think that I must do as much as a can because I will die soon. 

- When I go about my die, I'll think about how something can randomly happen that can kill me in the spot. 

- When I do meaningful activities, I keep thinking in the back of my head that I better enjoy the moment because I will die soon thinking I won't experience the event again or think I won't see my loved ones I'm with again. 

- I'm not religious so it's hard for my to lean into that to alleviated the anxiety of health and ultimately death. I start to get so scared when I think about death even though i know its inevitable. 

- I started doing 30 min cardiovascular activies and sometimes meditation. I struggle with meditation because I get an insane amount of mind chatter. It's worst when i sleep so I decided to get on trazadone again and it helps. 
- I remember my dreams alot and I sometimes confuse them with reality and it makes me super anxious because I think I'm going crazy or losing my mind. 

- I can do my normal activities no problem but I'm in a state where I'm overly alert on my body and always feeling anxious that I am sick and will die soon. 

- I usually get a song stuck in my head in a loop and it overwhelms me sometimes. 

- Some days I feel so overwhelmed and tired of feeling this way that I start to get depressed. I get so impatient and feel like I will never be my normal self again. I have a hard time accept anxiety and even the thought that I will deal with this forever. I have a bad habit of fighting it while I sleep because that's when I had my panic attack and that's when I'm thinking the most.

What do you guys do to help cope with the anxiety? I am trying to become healthier. I usually work 2pm-10pm but recently got moved to the 8am-2pm shifts (hopefully will promote a better sleeping schedule + more sunlight). I quit nicotine. I‚Äôm attempting to keep myself, my car, and room clean (hard to do when my anxiety/depression is in full blown effect). Any other tips?

I think I've had almost every flavor of anxiety disorder to be had at this point. I'm almost 20 and I'm so unbelievably sick of the physical symptoms, not to mention the mental terror or constant unease, and the way they just amplify and cycle. I didnt even realize that I've been having consistent panic attacks other than the very severe ones for years because I'm so used to being extremely anxious.

I just want it to stop. I've had 2 (3? cant remember) panic attacks today and I'm so exhausted, but I'm still scared enough to feel like sleeping will only end in either an inability to distract myself from the anxiety or nightmares because I cant stop thinking about it. 

my therapist recommended I ask my psych about benzodiazepines because nothing else seems to work enough to curb it. all the most popular SSRIs, atypical antidepressants, SNRIs, clonidine, hydroxyzine, buspirone... all hardly even (if at all) scratched the surface of the anxiety. 
but I'm absolutely terrified to take benzos, so I wonder how well that last ditch effort could even go if I'd be essentially triggering a panic attack by taking a treatment for one.  

I'm getting really hopeless about this. everything is terrifying, CBT didnt work because when I'm anxious my logical brain turns off essentially, I'm even too nervous to bother any of the few friends I have more than I already do if I can help it when I'm having panic attacks. this is ruining my chances of having a life I'd feel like is worth being here for. I'm so inept that I'd essentially need someone around to calm me down if needed at all times, and that's just not realistic. I just wanna feel safe and okay even a quarter of the time, I really dont know how to handle this. I'm really upset and it feels like I'm about to mourn the loss of any hope of a functional or even somewhat comfortable life."

I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, but we only started consulting recently (this will be our 3rd session), so she might not be able to give me tips only after 50 mins of talking.

I'll try to assemble a list of every method I've heard of and/or tried below specifically for thought-related issues, in no paticular order. Let me know which one(s) help you, share the kind of instances when they help if you want to, and you're more than welcome to introduce methods I forgot out too. :) (Hopefully writing this on phone won't f up the format.)

- STOP(P) method
- Replacing negative thoughts with positive ones
- ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) method
- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) method
- Journaling
- Talking your thoughts out
- Distracting yourself with activities
- Breathing techniques (box breathing, belly breathing, 4-7-8, etc.)
- Mindfulness (on the spot, not later)
- Setting an ""appointment"" with yourself to worry at that time later in the day
- 4 Rs
- 5-4-3-2-1 or 3-3-3 technique

I know that sadly there's no one universal method working for everyone, so what might calm you down maybe doesn't do anything for me and vice versa. I just want to hear others' thoughts and experiences about these. (And I'm aware that ACT and CBT are a lot more long-term methods than the other ""quick reliefs"", but I'm also curious about the effects of those.)"

In school I had a schedule where my first meal of the day was 2 p.m. (after school ofc) Not only these problems but also any social events, I feel same way or even being outside for me is already a problem. So stupid things triggered my anxiety, like trauma, just because teacher went to oral exam students I got so bad anxiety I thought I will vomit... I cant eat before even going out because I feel so sick and when Im done eating I get so strong reflux its very uncomfortable to live like this.

School was terrible, I was waking up at night contantly, was forgetting what I was learning, I was able to learn only 1 A4 page per hour, I started to have sleeping paralysis.

Also with this my social anxiety made me to almost impossible to eat with people and with strangers too, I feel so sick and not wanting to eat at all. For me its suffering to eat with people when rest are enjoying it.

I used to have 109kg, Now I have 80kg, I changed my appearance completly as in 18 I realised how disgusting I look and I didnt take enough care of myself. Most of weight I lost is because I stopped eating, some by exercising.

All my friends (I have only a few) all left to big cities or abroad, for 3 years I had almost no physical contact with people and when corona started it was like my progress was almost resetted completly because of lockdowns. People did not find me interesting or anything to go out, I made no friends in 3 years. I dont know how to socialise, how to make contact with people etc.

I had a job only for a little in office, people were nice there but corona destroyed everything. Boss became rude to me, disrespected me and was putting me down and he was reminding me same stuff I was telling myself when I was going to school, that im useless, im noone, Im not needed or wanted etc. Gave me false promises of payments and he didnt pay me some salary after everything. Impossible to find a good job or any job as I live in Slovakia and small town.

I tried 2 psychologists, they all were rude to me and made me uncomfortable. I tried psychiatrist was taking pills, and they did not help me but made me feel sick even more, I also was not realising what things I was doing and I wouldnt do it now again. Therapies I didnt even try, closest were 30km away and when I wanted to try, corona started... Hospitals treatments waiting time went from 3 months to 6 months and then 7-8 months but still it doesnt mean they will help you.

Only thing I was doing for last years was PC gaming, since 13 I was doing it pretty hard and didnt even socialise. It was one of the biggest mistakes and I wasted so much time doing it. Now I dont enjoy it at all as I lost so many interests.

If there is 1 person that would like to give me some tips how to battle this disease, I tried many things, I tried to ignore I have these problems but nothing helped or happened. Its hard to change thinking when I was telling myself these bad things for years and lived unhealthy."

Tonight I was coloring with my 2 year old daughter when all of a sudden I started getting a very weird pain in both of my legs. 

I was literally hobbling around for an hour because it felt like the blood inside my legs was on fire from my knees down. Tingling and slight numbness in my feet. Every time I squatted down it felt like someone was shoving knives into my calves. I called the teledoc and they told me to take a Tylenol (which I did) and it helped for a little bit, but still felt it slightly. But then I took come CBD and that seemed to help it A LOT. 

I absolutely plan on seeing my doctor tomorrow, but I also am having a hard time sleeping because it was pretty concerning. So in the meantime I figured I‚Äôd see if anyone here has experienced something similar, and if it was due to stress."
2447,PrthvRj,Helpful Tips!,3,Anxiety,1623998959,"We are hurting our body and mind by not being present and mindful. Anxiety is an unintended byproduct Someone in reddit suggested the book ""You cant afford the luxury of a negative thought"". Started reading it. Below is an excerpt

&amp;#x200B;

\*""Thoughts have responses in the body. Think of a lemon. Imagine cutting it in half. Imagine removing the seeds from one half with the point of a knife. Smell the lemon. Now imagine squeezing the juice from lemon into your mouth. Then imagine digging your teeth into the center of the lemon. Chew the pulp. Feel those little things(whatever those little things are called) breaking and popping inside your mouth. Most people's salivary glands respond to the very thought of lemon.\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*For some people, the mere thought of the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard is physically uncomfortable. Try this - imagine an emery board or a fingernail file or a double sided sand paper. Imagine putting it in your mouth. Bite down on it. Now move your teeth from side to side. Goosebumps?""\*

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered, a human has 6200 average thoughts per day. How many of these could be uncomfortable? sad? panicky? Many.  

Our bodies respond with a ""fight or flight"" for every imaginary fight we have, the heated arguments we had, the replay of everything bad that happened to you since your birth.  

Its not enough to have harmless thoughts to run in the background while you do your day job or watch tv. Because once negative thoughts(which are addictive btw) take over, your body is going to have a bad time.

&amp;#x200B;

Being present saves us from this agony.   

I have been meditating and reading the book Mind Illuminated for a week now. I could see a total personality shift. I am not my thoughts now. My anxiety reduced considerably(like &gt;50%). No panic attacks since.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I realised both these concepts are related and how every thought was affecting our body, mood and anxiety

Still, when I invest into a new hobby or skill my brain instantly requires me to be the best and if I can't I find myself spending an unhealthy amount of time trying to get better. 

For some things it's worked out, like with my current career which I was able to teach myself (programming). Other things that are more creative in nature though I get so frustrated with. I took up portrait drawing and got pretty far with it before the only thing I would do besides work is draw. Hours a day. Despite my efforts and obvious leaps in improvement it still wasn't good enough. What was suppose to be a relaxing hobby became a stressful obsession that I eventually had to set it down because it was becoming too stressful. 

Now I've taken up a new skill and the same thing is happening again. I'm being detracted from my day job because I want to be successful at this new thing. I read, watch videos, study other people around it to try and get better. Despite only having been at it for a relatively short time I'm starting to get the demoralizing feeling of not making the progress I expect. I know it's a skill way outside my comfort zone (streaming) but for some reason I thought it would be a good thing for me to do. 

I guess I want to be independently successful at something creative, and I have the drive for it, but the anxiety is always like ""nah, you shit, do better."" Until the point I burn myself out. I can't seem to pace myself. ""Just slow down, remind yourself you don't get better overnight"" doesn't get rid of the sinking, desperate feeling. It keeps ruining things I initally enjoy.

Need your help and advice. Sorry if I it's hard to understand, 

I just finish my contract with my current job and i happened to get called by old employer about job, exactly the same one I was there. I went on interview went well, so Wednesday afternoon I got call from the HR that I landed on the offer. Basically I'm a boomerang employee.

I was of course excited, but I am really aware of the job scope itself, very high paced and high stress. I just got on therapy and medication this year because I feel like it's triggering me back, back then I didn't know it's was anxiety (when I work in old place. I had horrible anxious/panic episode, horrible stomach bloating etc etc).

Yesterday morning I got email on the offer, then today I got call (i didn't pick up, I'm really ghosting them now I'm so cared), and message left by the HR to accept the offer by email as soon as possible . The exploding offer really got me super anxious and I kept thinking all the time because I'm afraid it will trigger back as bad as before.  My colleagues and my immediate was really nice and supportive, but the expectation to perform by my upper manager and the face paced work that scares me. Due to the history why I left there at first place, I thought it was overwhelming as I started as freshie, and went to career break for 2 years. In thier record, my exit interview said I'm on career break. Therefore, this times my boss expect me to stay at least 5 years or as long as I can,

I'm already past 24 hours to accept to offer or not, If I don't, I will still be jobless, if I did accept ,I'm just scared again looking back the expectations and the responsibilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Finish my contract, but got job offer at my old workplace which I expect my anxiety triggered at the first place, I'm on therapy and meds now, because I feel like it triggers this early year. I'm already due 24 hours (from email) and the HR keep contacting me to reply ASAP. If I don't I'll be jobless."

2463,RainAcademic,Needs A Hug/Support,4,Anxiety,1623992792,"Today is my birthday. I don't feel good. About a month ago, I developed anxiety. It cycles around with depression, which came back about 2 and a half weeks ago. I felt like I had been learning to work through it better. I've come to understand that I've been repressing my emotions a lot, and I'm pretty aware of which things I get irrational about. I hate the idea of ever being needy. I catastrophize about being forgotten. I close myself off from depending on people. 

So I've been working on being more open and vulnerable. It's been difficult, but I've been doing it. I've been making a huge effort to just let myself feel, the good and the bad. I don't want to shut down. I keep trying to remind myself that the awful things I imagine happening are the work of my anxiety and depression worming their way through me.

I'm not big on celebrating my own birthday, but I was secretly hoping that someone at work would remember. I ended the day realizing that no one did. I answered them whenever they asked in the past months/years. So now I'm stuck between not wanting to shut down but feeling regretful for allowing myself to be vulnerable, feeling sorry for myself but hating how I'm feeling sorry for myself, wanting to believe my depressed/anxious thoughts are irrational but having them validated. I've had moments of genuine hope and positivity, but I start to question them now, which just makes me feel more stuck and alone.

Even the ones who try to help end up not helping or making me feel more helpless. And I feel bad for them. I think. But I still make these posts because it's like I'm perpetually looking for some string of magic words to make everything go away. Or maybe just to vent into some sort of void and accomplish nothing. I'll probably be embarrassed by this in the morning.

I started working out five times a week over a month ago and I almost feel worse than when I started. I started therapy about three months ago and it feels like I have not even began treatment.

This mainly started about 4 years ago. I was very extroverted and ""quirky"" for lack of a better term. Somewhere along the lines I had an extreme mental shift and now I am embarrassed by every single thing associated with myself. 

If I notice that my hair looks off at a certain angle, the thought of it consumes me and I feel suffocated by my own presence, like I can't escape my head.

My expectations for myself are too high and I do not know how to lower them. I feel like I can never be fulfilled until I become the most famous and most loved person on the planet. When I receive a compliment, I feel bad because I feel unable to live up to that person's expectations.

I am obsessed with the way I'm perceived and I do not know why. Someone could walk up to my face and tell me that I am the worst person on the planet and I would not care. Yet I still do everything in my power to avoid any sort of awkward or embarrassing situation, or a situation where someone could possibly form an opinion on me. I guess I do not really want to be perceived.

I can't talk to my family normally. I feel so disconnected from them.

I talk to my friends about this sometimes but nothing ever changes.

Sometimes things feel like they're getting better, even for months at a time, but then they just get worse again. There is no gradual upwards trends, just equal ebbs and flows.

In social situations, I either get giddy over the most basic interaction where I didn't feel embarrassed, or I regret it and feel bad. I know every social interaction is supposed to better me, even the bad ones, but it has always felt like it's been generally a downwards trend.

I feel unable to do anything about this anymore. I've tried everything. I'm very much fully aware of all the irrationalities I have but that doesn't change anything. What am I supposed to do now? Just wait for my brain to work itself out of this? How long will that take? And how am I supposed to cope in the meantime?"

I have only had this happen for one period of time before, October-November 2020, where I became so intensely stressed about a number of things that I began feeling my heartbeat day in and day out for about two weeks straight with no breaks, even when I felt normal. And when I say I feel it, I feel every single beat, and it feels as if it's pounding constantly. Similar to having gone for an intense run and feeling that beat in your chest. I ended up in an ER after that first week of dealing with it and they told me all my vitals were perfectly normal. It ended up going away with no explanation a few weeks after it started.

I constantly overthink just about everything. 

Due to this, I am never able to stay in the present moment. This makes me be very unnatural and out of the conversation flow. Once the person/people to whom I was talking to, starts to notice me, my bit of social confidence collapses on the spot. Literally, my heart beats shoot up to over 150+ bpm, my facial expressions becomes weird/stressful, and I loose the ability to even speak a sentence (my mind goes blank). 

Then, I absorb the embarrassment from situation by everyone who is looking at me with pity/laughter. All of this causes me to dip into depression, and I become demotivated to go outside my home and talk to anyone. 

Apart from thinking about the past/future during a conversation, I check to see the surroundings if anyone is even casually looking at me (like every 15 seconds). If someone is, then I start overthinking what that person may be thinking of me. This again causes me to loose my attention and flow of the conversation and all the aforementioned consequences happen.

I want to mention one other thing: there have been times where I don‚Äôt face these issues at all. Whenever I am extremely tired, my mind does not have the energy to think about anything else other than the conversation.

My anxiety thinks the sun going down will kill me. Now I can‚Äôt sleep. Can anyone suggest a potential fix?

A bit of backstory. I (21F) have had anxiety ever since I was a little kid, but I was officially diagnosed and prescribed medication my freshman year of high school. 

The thing about my anxiety is I don‚Äôt actually stress about anything, I will just be going about my business and be hit with a panic/anxiety attack out of nowhere. I forget what my psychiatrist said it was called, but basically I just HAVE the chemical imbalance, not the thought patterns causing the chemical imbalance. 

My doctor and I recently decided that since I‚Äôm older, I might have grown out of the imbalance. We decided to try come off the medication in order to help me lose weight, since the medication I‚Äôm on can make it hard to lose weight, and no amount of dieting has helped much.
I feel like the medication is finally fully out of my system a month or 2 later, and I‚Äôm miserable. 

What‚Äôs weird is I‚Äôm totally fine throughout the day, but the second the sun starts to go down, my body just decides to panic. I avoid anything the could possibly be a stressor, horror movies, scary stories, etc (all things I really enjoy when I‚Äôm medicated or during the day). But for whatever reason, whenever  the sun goes down, my body just decides to feel like the dark will kill me. 

I‚Äôm walking around from about 7pm til Midnight in a constant mild panic. Rapid heart rate, flushed face, shakes, etc. and when I finally try to settle into bed at about 2am, I just toss and turn for hours. Some nights I‚Äôve only gotten about a half hour of sleep before I have to get up. I‚Äôve resorted napping durning the day since my body won‚Äôt let me sleep at night. (Before you say it, I know it can make it harder to sleep at night, but even when I‚Äôve gone a few days without napping I still can‚Äôt sleep).

All of a sudden in my rear view mirror, the car behind me has its lights flashing. My heart started racing. The car seemed to come out of nowhere too at the last second and it wasn't a typical police car.  I felt so unprepared. I pulled over to the side, put my left window down (he came to the right) and got my license right out, before he even approached the car. I told him this was my first time ever being pulled over and he said it's ok, just relax. I've had my license for a year and a half. I gave my license to him and for a second, I panicked because I thought I didn't have the registration or insurance but then I remembered quickly. He told me it's a 35mph speed limit. I was going 47. He went back to his car for a few minutes and I felt my cheeks were hot. I called my mom quickly. He came back and gave me a warning and less expensive fine for ""holding up traffic."" He didn't want to charge me for a speeding ticket. He said he wanted to cut me some slack. I thanked him and he said to take it easy and I said I'll be more careful.

It was bound to happen at some point, I guess, but it sucked. I feel like I'm going to get pulled over tomorrow for going too slow! I'm feeling really anxious now. I know I've got to get back on the horse but driving is something that gives me anxiety every day, and this certainly didn't help."

2499,Iyonia,Needs A Hug/Support,2,Anxiety,1623984237,"These past few days have been the worst days of my life. On the fifteenth of this month I had my first panic attack in years. My kitty, my best friend and baby boy, had been sick for almost as long as I knew him. Then, on the fifteenth I woke up from a nightmare where I lost him, and throughout the rest of the day, he wouldn't eat or drink much of anything. 

He'd been doing this for days, but that day was the worst. He was still himself, all sweet and wry, but he stumbled more than usual, and even though he clearly wanted to eat (he ran when the treat bag was opened and sniffed and licked at the treats), he wouldn't. He kept licking his lips like he was nauseous.

I became so scared. I started shaking, and before I knew it, I was having the worst panic attack of my life. It started a little after midnight and kept going until almost 8am. I had to be picked up by an ambulance at 5am because I lost mobility - I have a stomach issue too, so when I start throwing up I can't stop, and I didn't, until I was dehydrated.

That night, I had to leave my Momo with my boyfriends Mom, and stay at the hospital. I was so worn out from my stay (and it was getting quite late) that we chose to stay at a nearby hotel after I was discharged. Then, in the middle of the night I woke up panicking again. My boyfriend had to calm me down to get me back into bed, and when we woke up next morning it was to the news that he - my Momo, my baby, the love of my life - had fallen asleep and never woken up.

I'm heartbroken. I lost my childhood companion when I was in my twenties and away from home, and swore I would never leave Momo like that. I couldn't control my panic response. I wasn't on any medicine. I didn't have any personal doctors. Momo is my world.. he was by my side 24/7. We went on walks together, ate together, and slept in the same bed. 

If I left the room to go to the bathroom or to eat, he'd run out of the bedroom to fetch me. He'd be meowing, trotting, huffing if I took too long. And when I finally caught up, he would trot ahead eagerly, with his tail held high in the air with that little curl at the end, checking back behind him regularly and meowing as though to say ""You're still with me, right?""

I love him so much. I'm completely shattered. Nothing is beautiful anymore. I blame myself for this..for everything.. for not switching vets when I doubted his, so he could have gotten treatment for his cancer early on.. for not being able to calm myself down, and lay by his side when he needed me most.. for not being there to get him to the hospital when he seemed unresponsive..

Nothing matters anymore. I had to go to the hospital again after finding out, and was admitted to the psych ward. I know I need medical aid, but I don't know what to do.. everything has been happening all at once.. my grandmother passed away just last month and her memorial is in a few days... I would give anything just to have them back again.

I hate this. I hate not being able to control this. I miss him so much. I don't know how I'm going to keep myself moving forward. I just want him back so badly.

So, I figured I was ready to take it. However, I was extremely nervous about it last night and this morning, which caused my stomach to feel sick.

I failed to yield to traffic. The next mistake I made was when I made my left turn. Apparently, my turn was a bit too narrow. By that time, I was very shaky, and my heart was pounding. When it was time to perform my K turn, I completely messed that up as well, and went over the curb. After my K turn, the instructor told me to pull over. My breathing was shaky, and I spontaneously said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nervous, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to pass‚Äù. I was having an anxiety or panic attack. After taking a few deep breaths, I proceeded.

I do have pretty bad anxiety but as long as I can get through self check out with anyone I don't know trying to talk to me I'm fine.  When I first grabbed a buggy there was a man who was blocking my way and I couldn't get passed him because a worker was taking out the trash and as I stood there he was staring at me the WHOLE time.  He then eventually said, ""I'm not in your way am I?"" When he clearly was but at that point the worker was done so I shook my head and went passed him.  I got the items I needed but remembered I need to get dog food for my dogs.  When I got there he was in the aisle with another man and he was once again blocking the dog food I needed.  So I stood at the other end of the aisle waiting for him to move and he kept walking up and down and practically forcing eye contact with me and then after a good 5-10 minutes he finally grabs a bag of dog food and then when the other man that was in the aisle leaves he looks back at me and asks me if I'm married.  This man is clearly a lot older than me granted I was wearing a mask so maybe he wouldn't have known that but I feel like it was pretty obvious out age difference was at least 10 years.  I tell him no because I think that he's just curious or something I don't know, but then he asks me ""you got a man?""  Now I've figured out what he really meant and I instantly start to panic considering he was a larger man and he SPECIFICALLY waited until the only other person in the aisle was gone to ask me this.  I started stuttering and then he asked me again if I had a boyfriend and I just nodded and then he looked at me for a while and then started to leave, stopped and looked at me for a while more and then finally left.  I waited a while until I knew he was gone to turn around and pick up the dog food and I did need some other items but after that encounter I just went to check out.

To make a long story short, I‚Äôve taken sertraline (aka zoloft) on and off over the past 6 or so years and it does help substantially with day-to-day anxiety. I still deal with anxiety in other ways related to past trauma but it really helps overall. I (22F) have started seeing ADHD symptoms in myself over the past few years. I mentioned these symptoms to my psychiatrist and she recommended that I try a combination of sertraline and Wellbutrin before jumping to adderall. I‚Äôve experienced lowered sex drive and weight gain with Sertraline so I‚Äôm hoping this curbs both of those things a bit. 

Does anyone have any experience with this combination? Did it increase anxiety? Cause weight loss? Increased libido? I know it‚Äôs a rather common combo and I‚Äôm hopeful that it‚Äôll help more with my anxiety and ADHD symptoms but I‚Äôd love to hear from y‚Äôall."

Otherwise, I have been very well managed. UNTIL THIS SUMMER. In May, we lost our 13 yr old dog to cancer and it was heartbreaking. We made plans afterward to adopt a puppy in July.

Meanwhile, we have been looking to buy a new house and move for over a year and suddenly an opportunity has come up that is perfect for us.

I am a 32 year old male who has bad anxiety and depression but I work out and try my
hardest DAILY to beat it without medicine. I‚Äôve had a VERY rough go with medicines and just past life stuff. All in all, it took everything in my BODY to get the first vaccine.

So far it been a week, I‚Äôve just been really tired and just really scared of working out bc of fear of mycocarditis or whatever. I work out and it‚Äôs my only medicine. I cannot lose that. I already have anxiety sometimes when I go to hard at the gym and now it‚Äôs just been even worse. I keep Thinking my chest hurts and my tiredness is the vaccine but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just my racing brain. My mind is a liar!!! 

I just need positive words for the second dose. I am so so scared that something will happen to me. I can‚Äôt think straight even thinking about it and idk how I‚Äôll be once it puts me on my ass I‚Äôm sure. Or, I barely get effected by the second dose.

In need of advice and support please. From what I can remember I've always denied the fact that I suffer from an anxiety disorder primarily bc my symptoms have mostly manifested physically and my idea or comparison has been to those who have a lot of mental symptoms than physical. I do have racing and intrusive thoughts and while it does make me feel like I'm losing it, nothing is worse to me than my own body being in fight or flight mode at random moments of the day. I lost my gran a month ago and since then my anxiety has shot up and become harder to deal with. I suffer from racing heart and that unpleasant feeling in my chest majority as well as hyperventilating most of the day (esp at night). It just comes and goes when it wants to and I hate that. I never thought my anxiety could possibly get worse than it already has. I just feel like breaking down everytime it happens and it's starting to feel debilitating mentally. 

I went to the psychiatrist for the first time 2 weeks ago and it was actually to seek out a possible ADD diagnosis but she instead decided to treat my anxiety first and prescribed me Lexapro. I never wanted to ever be on SSRIs so I've chosen not to take them. The idea of having major side effects getting on them and eventually coming off them scares me so much. So at this point I don't know what to do and just wanted advice and support from those who cam share what's helped them lower the physical symptoms of anxiety."

Then I had a terrible week that ended in one the worst days I've ever had. A week before that day I went incognito and went invisible. I didn't want anyone to talk to me and I especially didn't want to talk to anyone. I ignored everything and everyone and eventually my mom let herself into my apartment to see if I was okay.  
I thought it was time to resurface and started replying to people; telling them that I was fine and just played with someone else. I told one friend group that I was playing with the other and vice versa. So lots of little lies to cover up how terrible of a week I'd had...  
But the worst one was to a good friend of mine who lives across the planet. She got very worried about me and I wanted to help her not worry so much. So I told her that I was too scared to call her (middle of the night - didn't want to disturb anyone local) called the suicide hotline and went to the hospital the following day and spent a few days there.  
But that wasn't true. I didn't call the suicide hotline. I DID stare at her name on my phone while I was losing my mind. And I WAS too scared to call. But I just sat here, alone in my apartment, and I truly wanted to die. I didn't want any help and I didn't want to continue being a stain on society. I punched myself as hard as I could multiple times. I cried my eyes out. I wanted to get away from these awful feelings but they were trapped inside of me. I finally fell asleep completely exhausted and I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had. I even wrote out several goodbye messages. Luckily I have no efficient way of ending my life or I would have. I spent two days in this limbo between life and death before I slowly came back to reality and asked my mom for help.  
  

Now I feel bad for telling this story about a serious hospital visit when the truth is that I gave up. I hate lying and I especially hate lying about this subject. But I also don't want her to be unnecessarily worried."

I went bouldering in an area that it seems people aren't rock climbing anymore but I still see the chalk so I guess someone does sometimes? Good for me as I have a huge bouldering area with no one climbing but me! haha. It's all these super good looking people in that area where the climbing area is as this beach area is nearby so I was a tad out of place ... but I still had a great time and just tried to focus on climbing. 

I had a couple experiences of people being a bit scornful in their looks towards me, I guess due to my appearance, but I'm not gonna dwell on it ... and focus on the countless people who were totally cool and didn't give off that vibe. Why let a handful of people, who likely are just having bad feelings themselves and who knows what their backgrounds are, maybe they had parents who made a lot of comments on looks, if that's what you grow up with you know, so not gonna let that color my experience when there hundreds of others who were just there having a fun time and didn't care about the wahoo climbing around. Haha. 

Most people were having a great time and were too busy with their own enjoyments and good times to care one way or another, a lot of people too are genuinely nice and I think felt happy to see someone out there having a good time as they were too so that was a good time also.

So getting wet depends on us, not the rain. We think it's the  sin we've committed that makes us sad. However, it is not the  responsible action itself, but the perception of sin in our minds.  Without this perception, would that action be able to upset us?  Likewise, we think that processes such as attacks, anxiety, fear,  obsession and thought affect us. However, being affected depends on  perception, not on the fact. Nevertheless, we continue to struggle with  thoughts, attacks, anxiety and fear, and we try to deal with the  phenomenon, not the perception of them. A heart beats fast while  running. Sometimes people tremble in the cold. These can also occur  during an attack. However, these symptoms do not cause any psychology  while running and being in the cold. We were told that we are affected  by the symptoms. We had to get rid of them with therapy and treatment.  The human brain produces psychology in the direction it is coded, not  because the symptom occurs. If we follow the path of the sector, hold  the symptoms responsible, try reduce them first, and then try to destroy  them makes our soul more sensitive to these symptoms. Every blow that  doesn't kill makes the process even stronger. The truth is that there is  no effect of anxiety when you are not worried about fear, and no effect  of fear when you are not afraid of fear.

I'm pro vaccine and the more people in my country act like idiots and protest against them the more I want to get vaccinated. I really, truly want to get my vaccine. But I can't. There's this huge mental block that I can't even explain but it has me convinced that if I get any of the covid vaccines I will suffer terrible side effects, regret it and then probably die. A year ago I wouldn't have given this a second thought, but it's been a year of panic attacks and increasingly more severe health anxiety.

--- This is where my anxiety fueled rant starts ---

The thing is, I waited too long and now I don't have time to get both pfizer shots before I have to travel abroad. And I can't get it there because I'll be even more scared without my parents around. And I probably won't be home for 5 consecutive weeks again for a long time (5 so I don't have to travel while I'm still nervous about side effects of second jab).

And okay I still have time to get the J&amp;J one. Except I'm a young woman which puts me at increased risk of blood clots. Which is one of my major fears. Plus I had a random high D-dimer test a year ago (not since then) so maybe I have some sort of tendency to clots that I don't know about.

*And* I get weird symptoms like shortness of breath and chest pain that are apparently just my anxiety. But what if it's actually an undiagnosed illness that will be triggered by the vaccine? Or even if it's not how the hell am I supposed to tell the difference between severe shortness of breath I experience daily and an allergic reaction to the vaccine? Or anxiety chest pain and myocarditis?

And like everytime I look for safety information on the Johnson vax I see stuff like 'young women should be aware of these risks and of the fact that there are other vaccines available'. Some countries don't even give young people the J&amp;J vax because of the risks.

So I'm terrified and I'll be miserable and in danger whatever I choose (or so it feels).

I really, really hate my anxiety... and my brain... and myself. I'm almost jealous of anti vax people because at least while they act like idiots and don't get the vaccine they're not equally afraid of covid.

They put me on Celexa (20mg daily) and Xanax (as needed), they ship my medication the same day every month, and the care counselors &amp; prescribers are supportive. However, this week has been a nightmare. My medications were supposed to ship last Saturday (today is Wednesday); they still have not shipped. I‚Äôve contacted them countless times and have received no update on when my medications will be delivered or why there‚Äôs been a delay this month. I‚Äôm so worried because by tomorrow, I‚Äôll be out of my Celexa and I‚Äôm terrified of having withdrawal symptoms. I‚Äôm also baffled as to how my medications haven‚Äôt shipped like they always do every month. I feel like I‚Äôm being ‚Äúghosted‚Äù yet again. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Feeling like there‚Äôs no one out there that can actually do their job and help me through medication management or my anxiety disorders :( Ugh."
2596,celestialcynic,Venting,6,Anxiety,1628701626,"I don't know how to live like this My anxiety cripples me.

I cry before making phone calls, and that's on the rare occasion that I can make the calls at all.

The thought of driving makes my chest feel like it's caving in. Actually driving consists of my sitting rigid and straight, knuckles white on the steering wheel, forcing myself not to think of anything but where my vehicle is in relation to the lines on the road. My mom says, ""You're doing great,"" and I feel like I'm being patronized. Afterwards I feel exhausted. 

The longest job I had was six months, and my anxiety got progressively worse instead of better. My working environment wasn't even that bad and I was really good at my job... but something about the constant influx of new people, combined with working in the dark as winter rolled around - I just couldn't do it.

I have to have my mom accompany me to any professional meetings, and have her make phone calls for me most of the time. The fact that she doesn't articulate herself as well as I could infuriates me for no good reason (and I feel so guilty for feeling this way because she's just trying to help me).

I want to be fiercely independent. I hate relying on others. And I know that level of independence isn't exactly healthy either, but it seems so much better than feeling like a useless child.

How do others with anxiety do this shit? How do you face your fears on a daily basis and still get by? What do you do when your fears get in the way of your survival? And why does everyone seem to swear by exposure therapy when it's only ever made my anxiety worse?"

Of course, if there is a problem with your order, I also want to know. If there is a problem that I can fix as an employee, I want to make things right for you. Please let us know if we can help you! 
This goes for call in orders, also. My main focus is on accuracy of the order when I'm taking it, I'm focused on doing my job right more than anything.

They also feel like they are out of control  and randomly said in my head. They are not thoughts that are saying something scary, they just are 100% random and it scares me and makes me worry about my mental health.  
So, the thoughts seem to happen mostly when I'm tired. I don't know why tho.  


I don't know what is the reason. Is it because I'm not active thinking or something?   


Some examples of random thoughts like this  


""Let's copulate"", ""Metallic dust"", ""That's why we are here"" etc. The thoughts feel 100% random. Sometimes they are in voices of people I talked to that day.  


I'm scared that it might be some serious mentall ilness like schizophrenia.   


I also took acid 8 months ago and had very bad trip. I'm afraid that it may be related to this and that it fucked up my brain.   
Since that time I have those ""flashbacks"" that makes me go back to a trip for a second. It's really scary and I'm not sure what should I do.

Ok so apparently our bodies are wired for  anxiety because the flight or fight/something is wrong/alert response was necessary for survival back way when as we were constantly put into high stake life or death situations (ex. getting chased by an animal we are trying to kill or being hunted by other humans).. our nervous system is still wired for that kind of living and doesn‚Äôt know the difference, except our current way of living is a lot easier and not nearly as dangerous so now our bodies are confused and reactive.

To cut it short and not make it unbearable, it‚Äôs concerned with my girlfriend and relationship. If it helps, we‚Äôve known each other since 5th grade and I liked her so much back then, but she didn‚Äôt like me back so after about 3 years, I moved on, and even got into my first relationship the next year, which lasted about two months because I got cheated on (yes, this can happen, even if you‚Äôre 14) and I ended it out of the biggest impulse that I ever had. My first relationship wasn‚Äôt all that much, just a lot of talking, hugs and some hand holding.

That same year, four months after i got cheated on, my then-5th to 7th grade crush confessed to me and said she liked me a lot (she started liking me about two months before i got into my first relationship). I wasn‚Äôt really thinking about her as much as i did way back, but I was still recovering from my first relationship and i didn‚Äôt really feel capable of rejecting her at all, so I got into a relationship with her. It didn‚Äôt take me three weeks and I fell in love again, this time harder.

That‚Äôs about the end of the background context. We are gonna have two years in october and this relationship is one of the things I am most proud of and thankful for in my life. That being said, when it comes to stuff regarding relationships and love, so to say, when putting things in the past into play, i have a pretty low self esteem, even though i don‚Äôt show it, i just know it‚Äôs there. And i get easily anxious and depressed by making up scenarios in my head about how she MIGHT be talking to other guys behind my back, how she‚Äôs pulling away from me (even though it‚Äôs not true and we‚Äôre still as close as we ever were) and how badly it‚Äôs going to end up.

Even me seeing her talking a lot and laughing with other guys in social contexts (which are not pretty often for us and I guess that makes it more uncomfortable for me) puts a huge weight on my chest. I know and acknowledge that the problem is not her or the relationship itself, it‚Äôs me. And this is why I‚Äôm posting this here because nobody else close to me that i‚Äôve talked to (parents and a close friend) wants to genuinely help me and they‚Äôve all called me fucked up and an asshole.

And so I get less and less motivated to job search and kinda avoid it, but there are voices in my head saying how much of a burden I'm becoming to my sister (I've stayed with her family after quitting).

This is just the latest incidents I've been having, but I was feeling it getting worse and worse as the years pass - the feeling of not getting enough air to breathe, the constant thought of how I'm not good enough and that I'll make such an awful mistake that everything will be against me. I just don't know anymore

I am planning on getting professional help but I'd really prefer to do it when I've moved out to live on my own with steady income bc my country is on constant lockdowns and it's just not safe to get treatment outside if I don't want it online (very thin walls in the house)"

2643,ivan-ian,Venting,0,Anxiety,1630303555,"Being in school with anxiety has been hell. I'm finally in my senior year and I can safely say that my anxiety has made nearly the entire experience dreadful. I hardly speak in most of my classes, and while I do have friends, I still loathe it. I don't remember much of elementary school, but the beginning of middle school was when it all went wrong. I realized that I was very socially inept and anxious. I didn't know how to make friends because I had been stuck with the same few students for the past 7 years, and we had almost no choice but to be friends with one another. People were friendly, but I didn't quite felt wanted. I often sat alone, and for a large chunk of 8th grade, I settled on spending my lunch period alone in my Algebra classroom than finding people to sit with out of fear of being rejected. Even though they were always kind, I convinced myself that I was intruding on their friend groups and they only wanted to spend time with those who really belonged.

In high school things got worse. I had a huge anxiety attack and emotional meltdown on the night of my second day of freshman year. My grade anxiety and looming fear of college, which has been an issue since elementary, worsened exponentially to the point of me breaking down during classes, with me either having to leave to cry it out in bathroom stalls, or doing it silently in class (or as silent as I could be). Anxiety, topped with depression, also started taking a physical affect on me. Sophomore year marked a decrease in appetite that would had me eating about one meal a day, or just not eating. My issues with sleep and muscle pain began to pop up, which worsened my junior year.

Junior year was an all-time low. I'd rather not get into specifics, but it left me with a fucked GPA, more strained relationship with certain family, and a greater hatred and apathy towards my education and future. This was when I saw my therapist the least, and I still need to open up to them about how awful last year was.

Now I'm a senior. It's almost over. I'm afraid to apply for scholarships and college out of fear that I will be rejected for everything due to the events of the previous year. My social skills have not improved and now I spend most of my time in my head. Things like the crowds of people and the sound of them all talking so loudly has made it so overwhelming that I'm considering buying noise-canceling headphones, but I know that I'm likely not going to be allowed to wear them when I need it most. I've never been to a doctor to be formally diagnosed with anything, but I know my issues are too severe and interfere with my quality of life so much that it's laughable to believe that I'm not struggling with anything. I still have no idea what I want to do with my life, but I just know that I want high school to be over with already."
2644,mike2835,Venting,1,Anxiety,1630303367,"I just need to let it out I‚Äôll start with what I believe is causing me to feel this way. When I was in middle school, about 7th grade, I had this friend (toxic) who I went to the gym with basically everyday. He was pretty cool but the problem was is that he was toxic and emotional. At the time he was a massive gym head and that‚Äôs all he would ever think about or do. I supported him along the way while helping myself out because I was a baseball player who wanted to start preparing for high school competition. But whenever I didn‚Äôt go to the gym with him no matter what the reason was he used to talk me down and made me feel like crap. I sprained my ankle, he called me a pussy and to man it out, I had baseball games, he told me to quit the gym all together and to stop wasting both mine and his time, I decided to hang out with other friends, he told me to never talk to him again. It came to the point where I was scared to say no to him because I know he will talk me down and just try to hurt me. I guess the one time that really affected me is when he didn‚Äôt talk to me for a month and told me to Kill myself just because when I asked him why he tagged me in a meme, he took it the wrong way and said that I got tired of him and I‚Äôm just a piece of shit who uses people. I started off with this little background because to this day, no matter who I‚Äôm talking to I get scared to say no to anything they ask for and I feel like any small thing I say or do wrong, they‚Äôll get mad at me and never try to speak to me again. Because of this, I started ignoring people causing me to fall apart with them. I cut off so many people in my life just because I‚Äôm scared to say no. Once I hit high school not only did it get worse, I found out many people were being fake to me, I understand it‚Äôs high school and that‚Äôs how everyone was back then but it really took a toll on me. I was about 13 in 7th grade, I‚Äôm turning 21 in about a month and a half and I feel like my mental state is the worse it has ever been. Im scared to state my opinion sometimes, I‚Äôm scared to say no, I feel like everyone is out to get me, I feel like I can trust no one sometimes, I just feel like Im a complete failure at everything I do. I have parents that love and support me, I have a brother and a handful amount of friends who love to talk and hang out with me, but yet I feel so lonely and I feel like I have no body. I live with regret everyday because there was so many things I didn‚Äôt appreciate which I wish I did now like my ex girlfriend. She honestly loved me and wanted to see me and talk to me every chance she got but I pushed her away which caused her to lose feelings for me. Everyday I feel lonely and scared of how mentally negative I became. In this thread I‚Äôll continue with my story of how everything got worse for me during the summer."

2646,pebblepulsar,Venting,0,Anxiety,1630302944,"Struggles with apathy 
A post about apathy struck a chord with me. I experienced extreme anxiety during multiple periods of my youth and it‚Äôs been bothering me that I couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt be properly happy (or sad, or any other emotion than anger) even though I am better.

For example, an extremely happy moment of my life occurred that should have alleviated all my anxiety when I was about twelve gave me nothing but a dull sense of hope. It‚Äôs like I couldn‚Äôt comprehend that things were better. 

I don‚Äôt get happy from any of the small things anymore. I get comments and kudos on my writing (yes, fanfiction, lol) and I barley feel anything more than a bit of joy even though I reads posts from people describing how happy they are each time. I only got really happy after my first comment, and that was short lived as well. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúride the high‚Äù for more than an hour.

My dog got out and was lost. I had to try and find him. I was unable to get scared beyond a slight sense of fear, which *is* good because it‚Äôs improvement to constantly being scared, but still disturbed me. I struggled to cry until I was alone and hours had passed, and even then I had to hyper focus on the fact that he was lost to make myself feel anything intense. 

The poor thing had to be put down. I‚Äôm very glad that I was able to feel a proper amount of sadness for him (he deserves to be regarded with deep feelings), but watching him get put down was so weird to me. I didn‚Äôt feel an intense need to keep him alive or a sense of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see him existing again.‚Äù It‚Äôs like I was halfway disassociating and the fact that I was saying goodbye couldn‚Äôt register. I grieved properly afterwards, but the emotions evaded me for far too long.

I hate my lack of emotions. It makes me feel like a sociopath, even though I‚Äôve caused the people around me no harm and never wish to. I‚Äôm alarmingly capable of anger (and the occasional burst of anxiety before I control myself), yet struggle to be appreciative and joyous, and even sad.

I don‚Äôt know if this is too relevant, but I also have OCD and I guess constantly obsessing and causing myself repetitive bursts of fear wore down‚Ä¶everything.

Nor looking for a medical diagnosis or proper advice. It was just nice to get this out. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to describe it properly to a family member, and I don‚Äôt currently have (or need) a therapist."

I think I've had anxiety for a while just never really addressed it.
Previously it was always tied to when I felt run down, and I think a fear that I'm dieing. 
When I took way too many drugs once in my youth, I had a major attack and there's always been a fear of death trigger since.

Usually manifests as a mild panic attack, where I feel like I'm dieing, sometimes feels like choking, rushing heartbeat, some weird numbness in either my face or arm.

Lately though during my sleep, or before I go to bed, I get this rushing feeling in my head that's hard to explain.
Like there's a pressure that flows down by eyebrow to nose, and my mind feels like it's racing. And also my bridge of my nose has a pressure. Anyway that sends the other symptoms off and I have to relax myself by breathing.

Before we get into the topic, I want to state I took medications for depression / anxiety &amp; sleep until maybe January or February of this year I stopped due to paying (student no job) and nothing bad happened until I got COVID in 2/13 and until after, I got a series of panic attacks for 1-2 weeks. The way I battled it was to walk outside with my dog for 30-40 mins a day until I feel calm. After a while, it stopped. Then sometimes I felt it was difficult to swallow or clear throat. Sometimes even now I feel uncomfortable in my throat where I just can‚Äôt close it or feels awful. Because of this, I can‚Äôt sleep properly and before would get 2-3 hours of sleep. Now with 2 melatonin tablets, I get 5 hours of sleep~ minimum now thankfully and I‚Äôm trying to fix my sleep. It‚Äôs hard to tell what triggered these attacks or which event made it that I am having difficulty with myself? Over time, I‚Äôve noticed I overthink things or thoughts pop up in my mind randomly and not sure if this is anxiety. Unhealthy ones or scary out of control things. Next, I feel tense a bit here and there with my chest or throat mainly. Last week Wednesday, I had trouble swallowing for 1-2 mins as I was out with friends that I had to return home. I‚Äôve been having trouble with swallowing for a while now. After covid, I believe I had it but then stopped once. Now as it is August, it came back again and I don‚Äôt know why. My question is, from January/February to now, is this a sign of withdrawals? How long does it last? What can I do to prevent this? 

I would take this specific medicine for anxiety/panic attacks prescribed by a psychiatrist but I use it when I feel anxious or tense and as the uncomfortable feeling from my throat goes away, these meds have side effect of dry mouth. Because of this side effect that I read, I am avoiding the med (hydroxyzine) for now and using throat candies (menthol). Is this globus sensation? How did you guys recover from the difficulty of swallowing or clearing your throat? Uncomfortable feeling in throat? How long did it take? Sorry this post is a mess but please let me know as I am desperately seeking for help advice! 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
* I‚Äôve been dealing with this a lot recently and not sure why. Has anyone been through this? It makes me feel uncomfortable and the past 2 days I struggled to swallow or clear throat for 1-2 mins. 

Also, I wake and sleep every 2-3 hours. I can never sound sleep. I am not sure why if it‚Äôs linked to the anxiety because of long haul covid but.. I never had this issue before. 

If anyone gone through this, has it resolved? I was infected 2/13/21. Then, 2/21/21 I had panic attacks for days like many of us who went through. 

Does anyone also feel like their heart rate is fast or feel aches in their heart?

I have seen a doctor and they said it is anxiety despite telling him about COVID and how bizarre it is since then it‚Äôs worsen. Going to see another doctor and have him hopefully tell my father what I need as he is against meds and I am suffering day by day. I always feel anxious and overthink things so much.

* I have done a EKG and there was nothing found except a diastolic dysfunction where the heart can‚Äôt relax. I‚Äôll be seeing a cardiologist tomorrow.. hope everything is ok‚Ä¶"

Last year, my mental health took a nosedive. I've been to therapy for a bit over 6 months now, but my anxiety has just been getting worse and worse. It started with health anxiety. I'd be terrified of my own heart because I do have PVCs and a fast heart rate, but that's taken care of, kind of. However, lately it's gotten really bad. 

I get really anxious watching TV, trying to go to sleep, I feel on edge all the time when alone, it started raining hard right now and I feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, going out scares me, staying in scares me... I'm miserable, but why is this getting so bad? What can I do? I took my last leave of absence from college because I can't take the stress of college right. People don't understand. I am EXTREMELY anxious almost all the time.

I've been on Buspar/Buspirone for 8 days now. It hasn't been helpful. I'm so frustrated and scared that it's only going to get worse and I won't be able to take it anymore. I'm getting scared because this is so painful. I have a day where I feel normal, and then the next day my family has to leave the house at the same time, I'm alone, and I'm extremely anxious and almost panicking until they get back.

I'm a freaking 20 year old male. What the hell is wrong with me?"

I never give a shit what me neighbours are doing and I don‚Äôt get why they are interested in me and have no shame in acting like a creep. I hate any kind of attention.

  So I‚Äôm about to start college tomorrow, now for most people this would be a very exiting time for them with some nerves here or there but overall ready to start a new adventure in life. For me though I‚Äôm sitting typing this in fear of what‚Äôs to come. I don‚Äôt worry about making friends, or being cool. I worry about my ability to understand the material that is given to me as well as my sanity balancing said work. 
  This isn‚Äôt my first time starting college or feeling this dread in my life. Every year since I would say third grade, when I go back to school I get very anxious and depressed. I rarely eat, feel nauseous, and have panic attacks throughout the day. I would come home and cry to my mom and dad telling them how I felt and how I couldn‚Äôt go back. They would try and calm me down and assure me that I‚Äôll be fine and I have nothing to worry about. This wouldn‚Äôt help and I would stay in this anxious state for about the first two weeks. Then miraculously I‚Äôm fine and I laugh at how I was feeling. It‚Äôs the craziest thing in my life and it has ruined me moving forward.
  I originally graduated HS in 2019, I planned on going to Penn state, was all ready to move forward and ‚ÄúBOOM‚Äù orientation day I get a major anxiety attack had to walk out mid presentation and have my parents calm me down from braking down immediately. I told them I wasn‚Äôt ready and I wanted to take a gap year. They asked me am I sure this is what I want to do or am I just running? I said no this is what I want to do. Since then I‚Äôve tried to go back one other time to the same result. 
  Even though I know these feeling are temporary and that they will pass in a few weeks I still can‚Äôt seem to think straight and push through, I always want to run. 
  I regret not just going to college right out of the gate after HS, it brought up more anxious feelings of being behind my peers as well as left me in a depressive state being at home wasting away dicking around 
in my crummy home town. Honestly I don‚Äôt know what I want to do with my life job wise, but I want to take steps forward to try and narrow my choices. 
 Any advise would be much appreciated. Thanks to anyone who sat through my sob story it means a lot to me."

I have had a close friend for 15 years and I have let go of this person and come back so many times because of toxicity. Its one thing to know through education (I work in DV and assault) how hard it is to leave a toxic relationship, it's another to live it. Has anyone here had to block someone on social media and let go of a longterm friendship? Last time this happened my friend was verbally harassing me (calling names, tearing me down as a bad friend. I've tried to only ever be a good friend to her. Was the only one really there for her when she was in rehab 10 years ago and went to meetings meetings her) and wouldn't stop because she was angry that in the midst of having my first newborn, dealing with post partum hallucinations and sleep deprivation, I forgot plans that we made. I did what I could to make it right but it wasn't enough for her. I had my daughter on her birthday (2 years ago).. She was so angry about having to cancel her birthday plans with her boyfriend because she had said she would watch our house and dog while we were in the hospital. She didn't give me any inclination this was an issue until she said some horrible things regarding it. She reached out to me during the start of the pandemic and I let my guard down. I regret it because three nights ago she went off on me about how degrading it was to feed my dog and sit around our house when her boyfriend had planned a party for her. She literally used the word degrading in response to helping me during the hardest and most special time in my life. She was my best friend and she said she wanted to help but come to find out she was pissed it wasn't all about her. She was mad that she wasn't in the birth room. I picked my mom to be there. She was mad she had to drive home in a storm. I'm sure I offered for her to stay. Anyway, I'm going through a rollercoaster between wondering if I should have blocked her because I remember the good parts of her and reminding myself that this is what happens with her and to just get off this toxic train for good finally. No one who truly loves me would try to overshadow my birth experience because of their insecure need for some grand gesture of appreciation. I couldn't control when my daughter was born.

Idk if anyone has experienced this or has tips for more nutritious (vegetarian) food that is 'easy' to eat when nauseous.

2703,throwawaythestrez,Venting,0,Anxiety,1617703154,"Feeling of inevitable replacement I have no appetite, I can‚Äôt sleep for longer than an hour, my whole body has a tingling feeling, and the same thought keeps running circles in my mind. This all immediately began after what a close friend told me today.

Today I received a text from my closest friend, and for the record they‚Äôre a female and I‚Äôm a male. By closest friend I mean we practically know 99% of each other‚Äôs lives and have discussed everything you possibly can talk about multiple times, and we talk daily. Neither of us have many friends to begin with and that‚Äôs by our own choice, so the few we have we are very close with. Anyways, they told me about this new guy they‚Äôre meeting tomorrow for a date. Being staged by others for her to participate, she isn‚Äôt looking forward to it by no means however it‚Äôll still be happening tomorrow/later today. 

After learning the finer details and having this conversation, it‚Äôs an understatement to say my anxiety of being replaced spiked. I immediately lost my appetite for the entire day, I couldn‚Äôt enjoy or focus on anything else as I began to already bite the reality ‚ÄúWhat if this works out and now there‚Äôs no more time for me except maybe once a day check in?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if this is the start to something that pushes me out of their life?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWas telling me this the beginning of a slow goodbye?‚Äù. 

For the record yes I do have a crush on them but I‚Äôm awfully afraid of the reality of rejection and what that could lead to(such as things become weird then we wouldn‚Äôt talk AT ALL) so I‚Äôve opted to act like it doesn‚Äôt clearly exist and hide it. The way I hide it is by encouraging them to find more friends and be more social and find their SO, all to which they themselves shoot down every time stating their general dislike for people and disinterest. My thinking here is I personally don‚Äôt want to see them with anyone because that‚Äôs my crush right and that kills my own fantasy world I‚Äôve built in my mind, but at the same time I do not want them to know about this so instead of discouraging the actions, I encourage them and do it frequently so that they believe that I actually would rather see them finding an SO and having a greater pool of close friends.

Now I‚Äôve known for a while that I have a massive insecurity of replacement. Irregardless if it‚Äôs my closest friend this applies to everyone, I have the belief that I‚Äôm not interesting to talk to, I‚Äôm ugly, I‚Äôm only knowledgeable regarding the like 3  deep interests I do have, I‚Äôm boring, but I‚Äôm funny and that‚Äôs the sole reason people keep me around. If it wasn‚Äôt for my humor I do not believe anyone other than my own parents would keep contact with me and I believe that with everything I have. Now knowing my flaws and how many there are, in my head it makes perfect sense why someone would replace me out of their lives irregardless of how close our relationship is. Why would anyone want to talk to the tech dude that doesn‚Äôt leave his house much when they can go befriend someone that has half the flaws I have, and is more than just being funny? In this direct case, why would my friend keep talking to me when instead they can replace the time spent on me with talking to a successful doctor and work on building having a family life with them instead of caring what‚Äôs going on with my day? 

As much as I am a successful tech dude, I don‚Äôt think it matters one bit. I don‚Äôt think anyone cares because at the end of the day I‚Äôm not exciting and interesting like other people, and I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time until people like my closest friend realize they can find someone entirely better to spend their time on.
This insecurity gives me an unthinkable level of anxiety because it‚Äôs a reality I accept early on in stages of any relationship, and now it‚Äôs been poked at and it‚Äôs ever raging in my mind. 

Nothing has even happened yet, and I feel like I‚Äôm on a time clock and every hour that passes by is going to be one of my last I can call them my friend. And then the date will work out and they‚Äôll leave my life and I‚Äôll have to start from scratch again, if I even can and who knows when I can. I‚Äôm hurt, I‚Äôm anxious, I‚Äôm stressed, and nothing has even happen yet but my mind took the concept and ran with it and I‚Äôm already feeling the pain of it."
2704,ongo3000,Venting,0,Anxiety,1617703133,"Went to the hospital today, my bladder was full and my blood pressure was high, was too afraid to get up and use the bathroom. Had catheter inserted, need to vent.  I had an online therapy appointment today, didn't sleep too good last night. I drink a lot of water, and had to pee really bad before the appointment, but my blood pressure was ""high"" (not that high, 133/77) and I was afraid going to the bathroom would make it much higher. I have a whole obsession about this, won't go into it 100%. 

My bladder kept getting worse, blood pressure kept increasing in a loop, got to 160/90 and xanax wasn't helping. Appointment was nearing closer. I had to cancel it. I could *not* get up. I had a panic attack for two hours in bed, and my bladder felt like it would explode. I tried to piss in a bottle, nothing happened no matter what. I was just too tense. 

I considered my options and was in extreme pain, I had my mom call an ambulance. The paramedics were very nice, and convinced me to stand up and try to use the bathroom. They grabbed my hand and got me up, I went to the bathroom and peed just a tiny bit. Still too anxious. 

After 10 minutes of trying, I decided to go to the ER with them. Got in, explained, peed more at the ER enough for a sample, and they decided to insert a catheter and a prostate check. That sucked, imagine getting a catheter and prostate check during a panic attack and bladder pain. 

I was laughing about it, though. Talked long with the nurse about my anxiety as she stuck a foot long tube down my peehole (kinda hurt) 

Started to feel agitated, but confident. I got all the way to the hospital without *dying* or even feeling *that* bad. In the ambulance my BP was around 147/88, which they told me was high but not an emergency. 


They wanted me to stay over night for a urologist to come the next day, or send me home with the catheter. Scared the shit out of me, all my tests and scans came back okay, I didn't see the need. I only have trouble peeing when I'm very anxious. I refused, signing the paper, and was referred to a urologist. 


I asked if there was something they could do like give me a sedative for the appointment, because I'm massively agoraphobic and can't go out of the house. They couldn't, but said I should see a psychiatrist about it. A psychiatrist would take so long to see me, and would probably need to go through a therapist first, who would likely want to see me a couple of times before referring me, if I could even get an appointment soon this week. 

They couldn't help me at all, I broke down crying there, first time in years, totally lost. Didn't know what the fuck to do. They just said ""ohhh...i'm sorry....."". 


But, 
I got outside, and felt really good. I knew everything was okay, besides maybe a urinary issue, anxiety induced or otherwise. It felt so fucking cathartic to go outside for the first time in a year, have an experience like that and just come out *fine*, even *better*. Wasn't anxious at all. Gonna try to go to an urgent care and get a few sedatives, I really do need them to go out. Waiting on the microwave is unbearable, a doctors office wait would make me panic without an ativan or something. 

Still, completely optimistic. Putting aside my masculine urge to bottle shit in, *this* is what people mean by toxic masculinity. Never wanted to address it and seem week. 

Thanks if you read this, long post. I'll delete after a couple days."

Hey all,

I've just started taking Fluoxetine (Prozac?) 20mg for the last two weeks - this is my first time taking someone to help with my anxiety and low moods so I don't have much experience in this.. 

I've noticed the last few days I've had severe brain fog where I'm struggling to communicate or feeling disconnected / disassociated from situations - I'm having trouble recollecting things or engaging in a conversation. Although they do seem to be helping to improve my mood. 

I know Fluoxetine takes around 6 weeks to truly kick in, but I'm not sure if this is just a temporary side effect whilst I adjust or if this is a sign that this isn't working for me as it should? 

Does anyone have any experience with this that could shed some light?

2716,curiouscat3121,Advice Needed,0,Anxiety,1617697574,"What to do for Newfound Insomnia: Anxiety or Something Else? HELP! About two weeks ago, I [24/M; white]was laying down for bed around 3 AM after grading some papers. Going to bed late is not uncommon for me as I typically go to bed around 2 AM or a little earlier. I laid down and as I could feel myself drifting off to sleep, I woke up with a start after getting this feeling as if I‚Äôd momentarily stopped breathing, as if there were some unexplained pause in my exhaling. This sparked a wave of panic so I sat up and called my girlfriend for a bit to calm down. Her reassurances that I was okay and watching a bit of tv was enough for me to doze off to sleep that night. 

Over the next two weeks I dealt with this issue intermittently where I‚Äôd sense as if I‚Äôd momentarily stopped breathing or as if my heart momentarily stopped beating. Now as for the feeling of my heart pausing, this is not a palpitation or what I know as a palpitation. I have PVCs, have been dealing with them since early high school, and am familiar with what they feel like. This new feeling is as if my heartbeat simply pauses, though I don‚Äôt believe this to be the case. I have an Apple Watch and, I apologize if this is stupid or unhelpful, an EKG read that nothing was wrong with my heartbeat and my heart kept moving along like normal. The only indication that something is wrong is that the otherwise normal line of the recording shift down on the chart ever so slightly. I‚Äôm not sure if this is significant or means anything. Nevertheless, the sensation will either cause me to direct my thoughts towards assuring myself that I‚Äôm completely fine or bring about a wave of anxiety. For the majority of these two weeks, I‚Äôve been able to simply reassure myself and get to sleep with little issue. 

This past weekend I drove up to my girlfriend‚Äôs to visit her and was unable to easily drift off to sleep either of the nights I was there. The first night, I got into bed and was met with the sense of my heartbeat pausing as previously experienced, though this made me anxious and I wasn‚Äôt able to coax myself into sleep. It took talking with my girlfriend for a few hours to calm me down along with fighting through my anxiety to get three hours of sleep. The second night, the same thing occurred though I was able to get about six hours of light sleep which wasn‚Äôt too helpful. The day I returned home, I was able to get to sleep without issue, but I attribute this to being exhausted and taking a melatonin before laying down. Yet, tonight I write this post unable to get over my sense of anxiety or the feeling as if my heart is pausing. 

I set up an appointment with my doctor about my anxiety for the earliest possible time, though she was booked until later in the month. I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety since high school and until now have been able to take care of it by exercising and generally taking care of myself. The pandemic and resulting isolation has thrown me back into some of the worst anxiety of my life to the point that I‚Äôve considered medication a few times, but am resolute that I need to go on medication now. In the meantime, I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to do about my situation. 

I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on either, whether my breathing/heartbeat sensations are caused solely by my anxiety or something else. Also, I‚Äôm unsure why it always wants to occur as I‚Äôm falling asleep. My girlfriend speculates that it‚Äôs my anxiety and that viewing this experience as a sort of barricade to sleep each night is only making it worse. If anyone could provide any insight or advice, I would greatly appreciate it. Again, I‚Äôm hoping to see my doctor about starting anxiety meds soon, but am unsure what to do to help myself in the meantime."

A week later I go see my Dr because they aren't stopping and now the palpitations are pretty constant with really bad flare ups in the evenings. Dr starts asking some questions and determines its not anxiety causing the palpitations it's acid reflux triggering my vagus nerve. The vagus nerve in return causes the palpitations and the palpitations freak me out causing a panic/anxiety attack that just makes it all worse.

I am not sure if this is the right post for this community but thought I woould share to maybe feel better about it.

M25, I don‚Äôt mean to sound superficial nor attention seeking, but today was my birthday and I felt sad/anxious about the outcome.

For the most part, the people I know I‚Äôm closest with they reached out with good wishes, though there were some that their absence was felt. And yes, I understand that  everyone has things going on and I don‚Äôt expect most of my friends, specially the ones who aren as close to me to remember my birthday, but that was not the issue.

I invited a group of 12 friends to come later by night to chill and sing happy birthday, and was practically ghosted by all but 3 of them. Of course, of all those 12 not all are the closest ones, but still, all from the same group, and if it were the other way around I would have surely attended their event.

I dont know, it felt weird, I‚Äôve never been big about birthdays and I do understand how lucky I am to turn another year and I‚Äôm really appreciative of the messages that I received, but still, this one hurt.
Kinda sucks to prepare and set up your place and then no one showing, specially with your family asking how was it and who went...

I‚Äôm feeling shitty about myself in this sense, as if yeah texts are good and all but I dont feel most of them made the slightest effort to try to come. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend that I will have a close group of friends specially as I get older, but still.

I‚Äôm usually not too hard on myself, and again, I know who my closest friends really are, but I figured that for a birthday most of the group would show up. 

Any advice, words, reflection is welcomed!"

I used to be invincible, resilient to all obstacles come my way. I used to be a daredevil, never saying ""no"" to a challenge, always aspiring for more, always reaching for the stars. I used to be someone.

And now, I'm no one. I'm lonely. I'm isolated. I'm hesitant. I'm repulsive.

I'm weak, avoidant of all obstacles come my way. I'm scared, scared of the unknown, scared of people, scared of places, scared of words and things and triggers. I used to be someone, and now I'm no one.

I first started showing symptoms during my first year of college, so, so far away from home. I sought help, and I received help, and I received my diagnosis and I was surrounded by people who cared about me and although I understood that my life from that point onward would be a battle, I nonetheless persisted. The daredevil in me saw my anxiety and depression and said, ""Bring it on, bitch. I can take it.""

And now, the music of my life has begun playing backwards. It's getting louder, and **louder,** and **LOUDER.**

The constant scream in the back of my mind. The constant pain that hangs overhead. Oh, how far I've fallen from Grace! I've fallen so, so far down since this horrific disorder began manifesting itself in my life. I utterly reject all forms of help today because deep down inside, there's some malignant, corrupted section of myself that is obsessed with blatant and aggressive self-destruction. There's a part of me that hates me.

I avoid places. I avoid things. I avoid words. I was hurt by people, and no matter how hard I try to be open, no matter how hard I try not to close off from the people around me, I catch myself slipping.

I've experienced too much trauma for one life. The root of my anxiety has always been caused by other people: the man who took my childhood away from me, cut short and tragic; the man who crippled me, and then left me on the street to rot and die, the physical pain of which I still have to persevere through every day; the man who traumatized me, and showed me violence and corruption and destruction and hatred and got me to understand that love is not real, that it's not something I should believe in; the woman who used me to relieve her own loneliness, took my heart, and then shattered it and got me to understand that I should never open myself up to friendships because everyone will leave me eventually at the minute that they don't want me anymore; and the people who make me feel small every single day.

Anxiety and depression are a vicious combination, especially when coupled with the raw pain that I've had to suffer at the hands of other people my entire life.

I used to be someone, and now I'm not."

For as long as I can remember I have kept myself blocked off from getting emotionally close to anyone. I have, even unintentionally, kept partners who were open and available to me at an arms length. I think this was just simply to not deal with any of the ""What Ifs"" that come in relationships. 

Last year, I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and see a future with them. Even though I was excited for what could come I don't remember a time past the first month that I didn't feel like it would just all abruptly end. Unfortunately, once COVID hit my fears became true.  After spending months happy &amp; without incident, My partner at the time started being distant and when I would ask him if he wanted to end the relationship he would say that I'm being crazy and he was just depressed and anxious himself. I tried to understand even giving him time, space, and support. We went from talking everyday all day to me waiting multiple days for a text that had no emotion behind it. By the time he actually got the courage to end it, I felt so defeated and crazy. I use to trust my gut with no hesitation but this person made me feel like I was going insane and that my anxiety had no basis when in reality my spiraling thoughts were proven right. 

Fast forward a year later, I have started dating again but my anxiety is getting the best of me. As soon as I start catching feelings I can't help but spiral into the thought that this person too will also decide suddenly that they will leave me without warning. The thoughts of being abandoned becoming crippling to me - I can't work or go to the gym. I try to remind myself that each person and situation is different but the negative self talk is just too powerful. I also find myself needing time and validation that I never needed before, it is not who I was/am at all. If the person I'm dating takes too long long reply or doesn't always have an upcoming plan for me then that too me says they are just getting ready to go ghost again. It makes me feel even crazier than I already do because I know that it isn't even feasible to expect that from someone. I know that rejection and heartbreak is a part of life but I just don't know how I'll be able to successfully develop a relationship when I have this new need to be clingy but also don't want to feel this type of pain again.

Not sure if this is the best way but if anyone knows of ways to be in the present moment during a relationship or how to go with the flow I would really appreciate any tips. I am tired of feeling insane, I want to go back to at least the little of me that wouldn't read into every little thing someone did."

I am especially particular about my bed. I have always showered and changed my clothes before I got into my bed at night. which I think is normal But I am progressively getting worse. First, I take a shower RIGHT BEFORE I get in my bed, I shower and then scrub my feet for 45 seconds with a scrub brush and then i step onto a CLEAN bath mat then directly into my slippers without touching the floor. After this, I cannot sit on any living room or kitchen furniture because those have germs from the outside world and I am not as picky about the germs on those things. I then wear slippers every time I get out of my bed after that. If my feet happen to accidentally touch the floor I cannot get back into my bed or put my slippers on until I wash my feet again. I cannot put my bare feet on the ground where I or someone else came home from a public place and walked around in their shoes. I might as well just go barefoot then and come home and not even shower. Then I put on clean pajamas and only wear them for 2 days at the most. If I get up to pee, I must take off my pajamas. This is a new thing I started doing because I would accidentally touch the side of the toilet or the trash can with my clean pajamas and it would annoy me because then Id have to change my pajamas again. Then everything that comes into my bed must be cleaned first. I disinfect my phone and my computer every night before bed. I cannot touch my phone charger if it falls on the floor. I wash my hands obsessively especially after I get up from my bed. I really don't know what Im going to do with myself because it is progressively getting worse. I guess I just hate the idea of another persons germs in my personal space. Im writing this because I got up to get a snack and the side of my pajama pants MIGHT have touched the garbage can and I totally freaked out because I was stupid and forgot to take them off.

Okay - the title is a little dramatic. It isn‚Äôt ruining it, but it is on it‚Äôs way to doing that if I don‚Äôt get a handle on it, and quickly. 

I am currently suffering through a lot of grief right now. A couple months ago two family members died in the same week. It was a really traumatic event. 

My anxiety has taken over my life. I am noticing that I am very cynical about almost everything. I have recently stopped seeing the beauty in most things. My partner wakes up every morning so happy to greet the day, and I wake up completely miserable and anxious about what is to come. 

A lot of shifts are happening at work due to covid and the change in routine is messing me up. I‚Äôm a teacher, so there is a lot of pressure to make sure I get things right (for the kids). I have to show up and pretend like I‚Äôm fine and everything is fine. 

The other night I completely blew up on my spouse about something sooo small and so ridiculous. But at the time, for me, I was so consumed with anger that I erupted like a volcano. I kinda scared myself.(it was never physical, I just yelled really loud at him and cried my eyes out). Since then we have talked and he is worried about me. He thinks maybe my birth control is messing me up. He also understands that the grief I am going through is a lot of take on. He is amazing and so forgiving.. and I just feel like I am the worst.. Also, I looked it up and I think I had an ‚Äúanger attack‚Äù. Not that I don‚Äôt want to take ownership, because I do. I was the worst. But the physical reaction my body had was intense. I couldn‚Äôt breath, I was shaking, I literally felt like I was losing control of my entire body. 

Anyways.. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting this. I‚Äôm hoping for some words of encouragement. Maybe a story about a time when you got a handle on your anxiety and how. How you communicated with your spouse about your anxiety.

I am seeking grief support outside of Reddit. Medicating myself is a last resort option. 

TLDR: My anxiety is taking over my life and my relationship with my spouse. How can I get back into the driver seat of my life? Any advice? Words of encouragement? Stories of how you got a handle on your anxiety?"
2754,pamplemoose81,Venting,14,Anxiety,1617679352,"My life with anxiety I'm 40 with an amazing family -- wife, 2 girls (ages 9 and 7), good career, nice home, and overall great life. Inside my head is a different story. This is my attempt at explaining my anxiety to help myself and anyone reading this.

I get panic attacks where my left chest going up to my neck tightens, breathing is shallow, and heart has palpitations. It can last for hours and every time I'm convinced the feelings are unique and I'm going to die. Other times I just have anxiety and try to work through it to the best of my ability.

Here are some thoughts on what triggers me:

#1 on the list is my own death, especially as I age. I have letters written to my kids and wife, not to be opened until I die. My will is ready and financial accounts and other logins are documented. I've cried and tried to prepare them for my imminent death on many occasions. My heart breaks knowing they'll be heartbroken and will grow up without me. I'm a total family man and they mean everything to me. I wish I could just believe in a God and awesome afterlife, but of course I'm Atheist.

#2: World events cause me to spiral, especially the ever  so common school shootings in the US. I'm afraid of a societal collapse so have spent thousands on preparing for the worst. I have food, medical supplies, and a fucking rainwater catchment system (which we do use for the garden -- which is also part of my prepping even though my wife doesn't know it). 

#3: My health. I was over 325 lbs and have lost 35 but that obviously plays into my anxiety as well. I'm on BP medicine so that does not help. I stay fairly active but have always struggled with my weight so it's a very slow decline. 

#4: Fast-paced environments. Sometimes I get triggered just because I've worked all day then come downstairs to cook dinner while the kids are arguing and wife is trying to tell me about her day. It becomes too much and I have to breathe it out in my bedroom instead of being with them.

Other random things in no particular order because I'm tired: Overall, I'm super fucking emotional and always have been. When I'm alone, you bet your ass I cry to sad or wholesome parts in movies. I wear my heart on my sleeve, which can be both good and bad. My wife has learned how to calm me down better over the 12 years I've been with her. On the outside I usually feel accomplished, but am so unsure of myself on the inside. My self-esteem is shit and I feel like a broken man and have to really give it my all to appear strong and confident at work and at home. Sometimes I come across as strong, and sometimes I fold. IT. IS. EXHAUSTING. Oh, and I was addicted to xanax for 5 years and went through an awfully hard detox while quitting over a year ago. I never took more than my prescribed amount but I was definitely addicted. I wish I could say I haven't touched them but now only take one if things get really bad, making sure to wait at least a week in between doses. I do take Wellbutrin and that has lessened the frequency of my panic attacks. The anxiety is something I live with, but it does help dummy it down. 

Well, that's my brain dump. I know others are fighting the same monsters and many have it much worse than me. Hopefully this helps a few that are in the middle of a panic attack. Please continue to talk about it and normalize mental health issues. Peace!"
2755,Apprehensive-World34,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1617679199,Are these anxiety attacks/panic attacks? I work at a restaurant and sometimes when I get overwhelmed I hide in the bathroom for hours crying until I can go home. I feel so scared and ashamed to come back out and face everyone that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm able to stay inside for so long. It can be for small things for example there was this one time I was working as a hostess and this huge table came in and the only table that was available to them was the one right in front of me. They were so loud and making all these noises and I got so overwhelmed that I couldn‚Äôt do my job properly like when a customer from the table would try to ask me something I could not respond because when I get nervous I start looking around everywhere and I‚Äôm not able to concentrate. As the table were leaving one of the guys called me stupid and I didn‚Äôt even say anything back to him because I felt like I couldn‚Äôt do anything I was so overwhelmed. This was the first time my coworkers ever saw me like this so they did not know there was something wrong with me and I saw one of the guys in the kitchen talking about me and copying the way I was looking around everywhere and making fun of me to everyone. And today a customer‚Äôs order got late. He was a regular customer and he was always friendly towards me even when his order was late.  But his food never was this late before so today he was a little upset. He did not even yell at me. He just complained that he had to go back to work and now that his food was late he did not have any time to eat it. But even this caused me to get so upset. And then an hour later the restaurant got a prank call and I just couldn‚Äôt handle it so I went to the bathroom for two hours and cried.

We had just one appointment today, I didn't get into much at all and it was pretty casual and surface level.

2761,wowitsapost,Venting,0,Anxiety,1617678102,"Anxiety reunion tour Hello, I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit before, I‚Äôm mostly just a lurker I guess.

I wanted to come here to vent because my family, as much as they try, can‚Äôt understand me/how my brain works. 

I have GAD, I got diagnosed last year in the spring (happy anniversary to me). It wasn‚Äôt such a surprise since I‚Äôve had problems with anxiety all my life. Since then I‚Äôve been in therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy), and for a while (maybe 6 months-ish) I was on lexapro. The lexapro actually helped me a lot, and I was able to function enough to learn to drive/get my drivers license (I thought I‚Äôd never get it), but it made me incredibly tired all the time. I would be late to work because I‚Äôd sleep through my alarms, I was sleeping 12 hour nights and then also taking naps, and I was just generally exhausted all the time. Anyways, I recently got off of lexapro and this is why I‚Äôm posting.

My GAD got way worse after I got off of lexapro for some reason. I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs a normal bodily reaction, or if I‚Äôm just faking it (but why would I do that), but the past couple of weeks have been terrible. 

I‚Äôve started having diarrhea every morning. Every poop is an emergency, seriously. All of the sudden I‚Äôll get cramps in my lower stomach area, and then I know it‚Äôs straight to the bathroom. My emotional regulation is horrible right now, I‚Äôll cry at the smallest thing, or on the opposite end I‚Äôll get so angry I can‚Äôt control myself (is that anxiety or depression? Who knows). In the past week, I‚Äôve lost my appetite completely. Along with that, when I don‚Äôt eat (or when I do eat, honestly) I get really nauseous. The past few days I‚Äôve been throwing up clear mucus because there‚Äôs no food in me (which is horrifying because I‚Äôm terrified of throwing up). On top of all this there is of course the constant thought that I‚Äôm bothering everyone around me and that everyone hates me (even though I know that‚Äôs illogical).

Anyways, I just needed to vent. Anxiety is so stupid and I wish I could get a new brain. It‚Äôs exhausting every single day. But, maybe this post will make someone feel less lonely or something idk."

So naturally I don't exactly keep track of important dates for the band in my head.

Last night, in my dream, a group of Nirvana fans were crowded around my dad's old apartment building. They were rioting about who knows what and singing, I was among them and asking around about what exactly was happening. Cobain came out onto a (nonexistent in real life) balcony, and started talking. I couldn't hear him, but colors and lights starting going all around him. Shapes and moving paintings and such. At some point, he screamed, and then there was a big bang and it was all gone. The people, the lights, him, everything.

I woke up with ""Come as you are"" stuck in my head, and felt a weird compulsion, so I rolled over and started a Nirvana playlist. I could not really understand any of it, but I felt in a weird OCD-type way that something bad would happen if I turned it off. The whole time, I was doing other stuff. Even watching a movie with the music behind it. It wasn't until like 10 minutes ago that I realized what today is, and it is like 9:30 where I am.

I turned off the music, but I feel incredibly anxious and like something bad is about to happen. Every time I turn it back on, it doesn't feel like it did before. Idk I'm like really freaked out.

I should have made my post on a throwaway, but I've been so apathetic towards life lately, I just lazily made the post on that account. I had talked on the account about a lot of personal struggles I'd be very uncomfortable with my parents knowing about (especially since a lot of those issues were the result of their poor parenting anyway).

There was an account that made a comment on my post, that had a username similar to what my mom used to go by on online. The account was made, commented on my post and 4 others, then got deleted. I can't shake the feeling that it could have been my mom, as unlikely as that might be.

2772,GoShrekYourselfff,Advice Needed,4,Anxiety,1617673915,"Finally Deciding to Try Medication [Possible Trigger] Hi all, I'm new here but just wanted to introduce myself and see if anyone had any advice.

I've been dealing with anxiety for years now, at some times worse than others throughout my life, and experienced panic attacks on and off along with it. Sometime about six years ago following a traumatic event near the end of my last serious relationship I had my first serious spiral and ended up going on medication shortly after but decided I didn't like it (likely didn't have the correct dosage and/or medication). I decided I was better and stopped.

Since then I have had on and off times of worse or better anxiety, but recently have started developing panic attacks somewhat infrequently again due to a relationship that is starting to get serious which is what ultimately triggered the first event several years back, although that one ended somewhat traumatically. I love her and she's amazing, I am just working through the trauma and having some fears that it will end up the same and I'll end up re-experiencing that same experience (even though I know it won't, my mind can't help but wander there).

Now while I've always encouraged those I know to get the help they need and fully support medication, I often don't provide myself the same support. I am guided by thoughts about how I don't really have it too bad, or I am faking it, or I should be strong enough to get through on my own, even though I know these aren't true.

That is until this evening. I had the worst panic attack since that event six years ago, and it initially started with racing thoughts like ""it's gonna happen again"" and ""I can't do it again"" over and over. This one lasted on and off for several hours and was utterly terrifying for me.

Ironically, I believe what triggered these attacks getting worse is actually her mental health worsening and subsequent decision to try medication. I want to be there for her, but realizing that she's struggling and I might not be strong enough to help her is triggering the feeling that its inevitably going to happen again and I'll have to relive that trauma with someone I care about much deeper. This is why I want to try it and get better finally. I'm scared to try it, I'm afraid it'll change who I am, or that my condition isn't serious enough for medication and I should just try harder. I am going to bring it up to my therapist tomorrow, and I just wondered if anyone had any advice/stories they could share about starting medication for anxiety and how it went for them."

If you have really consistent severe anxiety, along with symptoms such as feeling cold or hot all the time, unexplained weight gain or weight loss, feeling super agitated or fatigued, fast or slow heartrate, feeling like your eyes are either sunken or somewhat bulging more than before, dryer skin, diarrhea or constipation, aches and pains, a sense that things seem darker or brighter, insomnia etc., get your thyroid levels checked. Don't just get the TSH checked, get a full panel done along with antibodies after talking to your doc. 

There are common autoimmune conditions that can cause extreme levels of anxiety and jitters as well as fatigue. Hashimoto's for example occurs in approx 12-14 million americans and can cause fluctuations between hypo and hyperthyroidism. Graves disease causes the body to produce way too much thyroid hormone, ramping up the speed of everything, making your eyes somewhat swell, you may run hot often, feel aggitated and anxious consistently, and so on and so forth.

Thyroid conditions are incredibly common affecting possibly over 10% of the population, and reminder: it affects both men and women. So def get it checked if you align with anything here."

I had a bit of a panic attack before going, where I was shaking, crying, and just overall in a bad mood. I took a clonazepam, which took a bit to kick in, but I pushed through it and drove to the vaccination site even though the whole time I just wanted to cancel. I got there, checked in, waited in the line all while either playing games on my phone or watching something on my phone to keep myself occupied.

When I finally got to the table where I was getting my vaccine, I had a bit of anxiety but overall felt relatively okay. I told the worker who was administering my vaccine that I was a bit anxious, and we made some small talk which helped settle my nerves. I got the shot which didn‚Äôt hurt at all.

I waited my 15 minutes, continuing watching stuff on my phone, and that time went by pretty quick. Then I went to check out and schedule my second dose - I felt a bit off when I first stood up and got in line, but it was because my breathing had been a bit shallow and I just needed to gather myself.

Now for the side effects. I had covid, so I was highly concerned I would feel terrible. I had a sore arm, and that was it.

Reasons not to give up-besides the cliche I really like this girl, I really need a friend. I‚Äôve been very alone and just texting her makes me feel better. In addition, I am part of the marching band. Last season I was probably the most suicidal I‚Äôve ever been, even went to the hospital for it. Luckily, this girl is in the band, and if I can maybe make one good friend I can maybe make other friends. But whenever I talk to her I feel like shit knowing I can‚Äôt be more and attract her. And I‚Äôll prolly never be ok with just being friends. But I need the friend.

I have been looking into getting a life beyond girls btw. Issue- I have applied for multiple entry level jobs and still not gotten a response. Studying in school is going well but due to anxiety and depression on multiple other areas in my life it has slacked a little bit, but I‚Äôm still pretty good. I workout 6 days a week. I just need a social life that I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never get, and of course one chance that I get to develop that social life and I catch feelings smh.

I need help because besides the many many many other stresses in my life this one is on my mind right now. Being me, I need to clear one thing before moving on to the next. There are a lot of rebuttals I can give to answers that are given. I have thought about this way too much. My anxiety basically telling me that I suck and that I won‚Äôt amount to anything sucks too. Overthinking sucks. So not only do I need to figure out what to do here, I need to figure out how to deal with this anxiety"

2802,Markz2137,Helpful Tips!,3,Anxiety,1619261439,"Looking to get your mind off of things? Hello, 
Anxiety and derealization is still a fairly new thing that I have had to deal with (just over 2 years) so I understand that this may not work for everyone and that my anxiety is most likely not as severe as some peoples. 

One thing I find that has helped me get my mind off of constantly thinking about my worries/ even constantly thinking about my anxiety is playing brain and thinking games on my phone (Sudoku, crosswords, word searches, memory games etc.) I feel like they completely take away my attention from whatever is causing my anxiety and allow me to relax (except when they‚Äôre really hard).

It also works with other games but I found these most useful because they can be played anywhere on my phone, and require a lot of thinking ( with me other games still allow in some intrusive thoughts) and they help take me away from a situation if I start to panic.

I don‚Äôt suggest however using them constantly to hide from/ retreat from situations that make you anxious, because I strongly believe in exposure therapy. Instead using them when it has gone past feeling anxious and you really need to clear your mind for a while.

Remaining positive and accepting that I have anxiety has also helped tremendously, 

Hope this helps someone even the smallest bit.

Thanks for reading."

I ask myself a lot where I went wrong, what happened to me and why am I like this now? I‚Äôve had everything go my way, I‚Äôve got a Masters degree and good paying job but I‚Äôm still not happy and I‚Äôm filled with anxiety that effects my work/life DAILY. I have been diagnosed with GAD, health anxiety (somatic symptom disorder), and OCD just from obsessive symptom checking/scanning my body/ hyperawareness. 

I remember the first time I experienced a panic attack and I wasn‚Äôt sure of what it was, it was fall of 2014 during college, I had to leave class bc I was so dizzy and felt like I was going to faint I went to the ER &amp; that‚Äôs where this shit show begins....I was scared shitless to have another one. After that first one they just kept coming at random times, I started to fear them (concerts, gym, grocery store, work.) that‚Äôs when it got bad, I used to leave places and head to the ER, until I started to understand it was anxiety doing this, but from 2018-2020 my anxiety/panic attacks really messed me up, I didn‚Äôt leave my house much, quit going to the gym, gained weight, starting drinking alcohol which I never had previously. I started doing research and realized I was experiencing panic disorder and I seen a therapist and eventually I got back to my normal life without panic attacks around spring of 2020, from April 2020-now I‚Äôve lost weight, in the best physical shape of my life, I used to weigh 185 I‚Äôm down to 145 and feel so good about my body now! But here‚Äôs where things get tricky, right around summer of 2020-now I started experience GERD/LPR issues and got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia and my goodness that was terrible news for me because you can‚Äôt fix a hiatal hernia without surgical intervention and although mines tint (1cm) it does cause symptoms and they suck, but most are under control but this causes my anxiety to absolutely sky rocket, and I‚Äôm going to explain why and what I‚Äôm dealing with rn.

I‚Äôve developed the fear of choking......why I couldn‚Äôt tell you bc I‚Äôve never choked but I had globus sensation from LPR for around 6-8 months and was eating less (helped me lose weight), and now this year it started in March I have like been afraid of choking and I don‚Äôt eat nearly enough, and all anatomical causes have been ruled out so it‚Äôs definitely psychogenic but it‚Äôs messing me up bc I can‚Äôt afford to lose much more weight, if it wasn‚Äôt for weight lifting I‚Äôd probably be very very skinny. My ENT who diagnosed me with LPR is the one who told me to consider going on an SSRI so I went to my PCP and spoke with him and he said he‚Äôd think it would be great for me to try and gave me Lexapro, the Lexapro has been in my cabinet for 2 months now just sitting there (2.5mg for 2 weeks) to see if I can tolerate it then move up. Someone like me, who fears medication side effects and has health anxiety I just know when I take it I‚Äôll think 1. I‚Äôm dying 2. Allergic reaction 3. Side effects will make me quit. Now I know side effects ware off and some don‚Äôt even experience them but I just know with me I‚Äôll be dizzy one day and say I‚Äôm quitting them, but then part of me doesn‚Äôt wanna go through life feelings how I do bc I seriously think it‚Äôs holding me back from advancing at work, taking a toll on relationships, friendships bc I‚Äôm always ditching plans, my family doesn‚Äôt see me much anymore and idk why but I get irritated when anyone calls me it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even want to be bothered. All I do pretty much is work, go to the gym with my friend 5-6 times a week, and play basketball on Sundays. I haven‚Äôt had alcohol in over a year and never plan on drinking it again, I just want to feel like I did when I was in HS and didn‚Äôt have anxiety at all and was much more enjoyable to be around, that‚Äôs all."

2810,FeelThePower999,Needs A Hug/Support,3,Anxiety,1619254507,"Cardiophobia is ruining my life I live in constant fear that I am having or about to have a heart attack. As I type I am wondering whether or not to call 911 because of a chest pain I've woken up with.

I check my heart rate constantly. I take my blood oxygen constantly. I have called the doctor so many times, but I am never re-assured. The doctors brush me off telling me I'm too young (24) to get angina or coronary heart disease. But I knew someone who was 19 who died of a sudden cardiac death.

I have been doing a lot of lifting and moving and I have been under a LOT of stress lately, but any chest pain causes overwhelming anxiety that I cannot shake. It is all-encompassing and nothing I do can distract myself from it. I've even had several full-blown panic attacks due to feeling a sensation in my chest. The slightest twinge or indigestion and I instantly become overwhelmingly convinced I'm having a heart attack.

I've been told a lot of my symptoms could be anxiety (I am always very tensed) but I don't believe that. I think I have a really serious heart condition that is going undiagnosed because the doctors are brushing me off as ""too young for a heart condition"".

Cardiophobia has been ruining my life for several months now. It was triggered last year when I watched my father have a sudden heart attack and die. It came out of absolutely nowhere with zero warning. He was fine, then he clutched his chest, shouted ""I think I'm having a heart attack!"" then keeled over and died before the ambulance could arrive.

As I speak I am suffering a chest pain and don't know what to do other than sit in my room and panic. I don't want to call 911 in case they take me to hospital for days and I catch covid and give it to mom. I already lost one parent, I don't want to lose the other.

It's the not knowing whether or not this chest pain is something nefarious that is really making me into a hot mess. Not an hour goes by where I don't worry I'm having a heart attack or about to have one."

2813,AprilBelle08,Discussion,4,Anxiety,1619254290,"What I wish I could say on social media This is one of the most personal, hardest things I've ever had to say, but I feel its no longer healthy to keep it a secret, and constantly be ashamed of myself.

People may be wondering why I'm sharing it, but I'm such a big believer in being open and supportive about mental health, yet I treat my own like its a dirty little secret.

My whole life, I have struggled with anxious behaviour. This came to a head in 2016, when I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. I was put on medication for this which has helped enormously, although of course its not a cure. I have good days and bad days. On a good day, I barely feel anxious. On a bad day, I can barely drag myself out of the house and function normally. The only way I can do this is to put on a face and just pretend I'm worrying over something, when inside my head I'm creating many negative thoughts and scenarios.

I have also recently been diagnosed with body dysmorphia disorder. This is something I am currently receiving cognitive behaviour therapy for. Again, this is something I suspect I have suffered from for most of my life. 

The other day I was having a conversation with my husband about being unable to go to certain social events because of my anxiety. I said to him, I wish I could just say to the host ' I'm thankful for the invitation and wish the event well, but unfortunately due to my mental health, I won't be attending, as it will be detrimental to me'. I feel this is part of the stigma as I would have no problem saying, sorry, I can't come to your wedding/birthday party/housewarming or whatever, because I've got a stomach bug etc. But I feel embarrassed telling someone the truth that I can't attend an event because it would set me back with my mental health. I appreciate that I'm part of the problem here because I could just tell people about my anxiety, but its not as easy as that. I'm sure I've looked rude or unreliable over the years as I'll often drop out of invitations just before the event, sometimes minutes before. I don't mean to be rude, but sometimes I genuinely cannot face it, physically or mentally. And yes, its easy to say, well why didn't you tell the host you were struggling and wouldn't be attending? Unfortunately, you've got the anxious voice at the back of your mind saying you must keep this to yourself. They'll think less of you. Mental health must be kept as a secret.

This is a mindset I'm trying so hard to get out of. I'm not sure I know anyone who has perfect mental health. I wholly support talking to people about it, I'm very empathetic about it. So why can't I be supportive about myself? I don't want to be part of the stigma of mental health.

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this. Most of you will see me and I will still be the same person, as I've spent a lifetime covering up my anxiety. I come across as a worrier, sure, but that doesn't scratch the surface. I don't want people to think any less of me, or judge me or treat me differently. I'll still be the same person tomorrow that I have been for the last 28 years. I guess I just want to forewarn people, please don't be offended if I'm unable to attend your event. A big part of my disorder is social anxiety. What might be a lovely day/party/meal out may leave me sobbing for hours due to the compressed anxiety/triggers.  

I'm not saying all this as an excuse. It won't be the case that every single event you invite me to, I'll decline and cry out ANXIETY. Some of you may be thinking, I've never known you to not go or attend xyz. These things come and go. If I normally see you or accept your invite 50 weeks of the year, please don't be offended if I can't make the other 2 weeks for what seems like an excuse. Going forward, I want to be able to say to people 'Sorry, I won't be attending for reasons I've explained'. I hate the thought of people thinking I'm unfriendly or that I've got a problem with them, just because I'm too scared to admit I've got less than perfect mental health.

I will continue to live my life the best I can and am looking forward to continuing my CBT to try and be in a better place. I want to feel better. But I'm tired of keeping anxiety my dirty little secret."

2815,patheticco,Uplifting,8,Anxiety,1619253323,"Anxiety is a lying PoS that wants us to suffer So yesterday I got into my own head (again). I was at work when anxiety started to creep in, telling me that I have something important to tell to my family member that would sort of withdraw some help they could use (but would most likely make my life complicated and induce anxiety). I started having panic attacks, anxiety was telling me there would be a big fight and they would never want to speak to me again, I'll lose them forever. As the day was passing, I started having more and more panic attacks, couldn't breathe and felt like someone was sitting on my chest. It was a struggle to think and focus on other things I needed to do. When I finally talked to this family member, they asked some questions about our situation and completely understood my position and why I can't help them. Everything was completely fine. Then my anxiety said ""okay, but tomorrow is another story, tomorrow you will find out how they really feel about this"". Yeah, no, today is still completely okay. I am not thrown away. I didn't lose anyone. There wasn't a big fight. I'm still speaking to this person.

So everything my anxiety told me was a terrible lie. Anxiety tried to scare me off, make me believe my own worst fears would come true. It is so completely evil and cruel to me, yet it is a part of me that I can't get rid of. And even though I know that it's lying most ot the time, I still always believe it rather than believing myself or someone else. What's worse, if it was a person, I wouldn't be friends with them, so why am I friends with my anxiety? Why is it always with me, talking to me and why am I here still listening, believing and responding to its lies?

This is probably something you already knew, I knew it too, but I always forget and fall for its lies again. That's why I posted this - to show you and to show myself that we wouldn't let someone treat us that way, so why do we let our mental health issues treat us like that?

It's like being in an abusive and toxic relationship with ourselves."

2 nights ago I had several near misses, seemingly out of nowhere. 
And last night I felt it approaching but was able to distract myself with the company of my lovely boyfriend. 

I‚Äôve always consumed excessive caffeine since I was about 12. 26 now. 
It started with coke, which moved to ice coffee. Which then became iced coffee and coke daily. Sometimes I throw in an energy drink just to spice it up. 

I‚Äôm going to cut out caffeine and see if that has any affect on my anxiety. 
But it‚Äôs hard to know as I‚Äôve always had anxiety. And I‚Äôve always consumed coffee. 

Caffeine, as far as I‚Äôm aware, doesn‚Äôt really affect me. I could drink a cup of coffee and still go to sleep an hour later.

 When I told my mom a few minutes later, she was confused as to why I did that and told me I really should call them back and say I misspoke and I actually wanted the job. Thats was so damn stressful but I did it while on speakerphone with my mom next to me lol. They were kinda confused cuz I just turned them down 20 minutes ago, but they said if I was sure then they'll still give it to me. I said yes and they said to text them they'll send me some official forms later and said some stuff about clothes I kinda zoned out on like a dummy but thats a whole other thing. 

And now, I'm anxious if they're going to even respond cuz they seem kinda sus looking back. I also don't know what I'm supposed to do with the clothing store. Do I just make up some BS and say I can't work anymore? I'm also concerned I may get too many hours at the VR place because they never really told me how many hours they plan to schedule and I really don't want more than 25. Sorry for ranting. I'm just so stressed and had to let it out."

2826,Hansolio,Helpful Tips!,3,Anxiety,1619249498,"This my personal top 3 of causes of panic attacks This is my personal experience so it might be different for you!

1) Dehydration: many times when the panic feeling came up, I realised I drank too little that day. Remember also that a hangover is related to dehydration. So I binge drink 2 or 3 glasses of water and I feel instant relief.

2) Not enough sun: I first took vitamine D supplements  because a blood test showed low values. Suddenly I also felt less anxious. Talk with your doctor because sometimes you need very high doses (&gt;25.000 Units) to really improve your numbers.

3) Low Magnesium: I am on PPI's for more than 20 years so magnesium intake is impaired as a result. So supplements are a must. Thats is when I noticed that it has a huge effect on my anxiety as well. But be careful: there are many forms of magnesium and some of them are hardly absorbed, especially when on PPI's. So try to find the best one for you. Also don't take it at the same time as the PPI but keep at least 12 hours in between. I take the magnesium at night, which also improves my sleep. One more thing: Absorbing vit D drains your magnesium levels so do both of them.

What is your top 3?"

I considered fleeing. but I caught myself spinning out... Literally covered in sweat, so embarrassed, barely breathing, then I realized my anxiety was lying to me about a whole bunch of things, and I managed to refocus on just doing the next thing. My mind was spinning, playing the ""what if""/worst-case scenario game. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I looked at the door and considered leaving a better alternative to feeling so disgusting. I had to ""fan"" my shirt to try to dry off the pool of sweat. Oh god, it's going to soak through my shirt. People are going to see me like this.

I was able to recognize and label my anxiety. That helped me slow the spinning thoughts. I closed my eyes for a second and took some slow breaths. The first few were difficult, and it didn't feel like things were getting better. But my mind was slowing and coming down from the anxiety. The shirt fanning cooled me down a wee bit, and I let myself feel ok about it being slightly less awful. I still didn't know what was going to happen next, and I was terrified that I wouldn't be the right person for the job, but I just did the next thing and kept breathing.

I don't feel like this was a huge breakthrough, but it was a step in the right direction, and I'm trying to acknowledge that and appreciate it.

Long time sufferer of GAD, had my fair share of mild anxiety attacks, but now I've started having unprompted panic attacks once every few months. Could be worse, but still very jarring when my heartrate soars of nowhere and I have to quickly figure out how to handle what I know is about to come.

Had my second big panic yesterday. Calm all day, no anxiety, sat up to do some late homework and was hit with a quickly rapid heartrate, hyperventilation, and a very repetitive thought of ""fuck, fuck, fuck not now, ok breathe you've been through this before it's ok"" to absolutely no avail. Took a crying session and a miserable call to a bestfriend a few states over to get my heart down enough for me to be able to sleep.

I've noticed though that my heart rate has been pretty high than what it usually is afterwards (resting for me is typically in the 80s, but it's been around 97-110 all day). Might be just the anxiety of hoping it doesn't happen again and I KNOW I have to stop checking my heartrate because that's what keeps it up (also diagnosed with OCD, checking my heart rate is, without a doubt, my worst compulsion), but man it really freaks me out.

The worst part is my breathing. My chest feels so constricted, even if it's been a full 24 hours now. I breathe in real deep and I feel this... almost tickling sensation that causes me to break out into a fit of coughs. Don't feel necessarily out of it or sick, but a quicker heartbeat and tight chest makes the anxiety so much worse, yanno?

Just was wondering if anybody's felt the aftermath of a panic well into the very next day, particularly with shortness of breath and tight chest. Just trying to make sure I'm not dying and accidentally mistaking it for a panic. What with the pandemic, you can't be too sure! Thanks in advance."

I had a huge argument with my partner of 7 years tonight and ended with him calling it quits. It felt final. I spent 3 hours shaking in bed and throwing up, and finally decided to call Samaritans.

(Description) So I've suffered with GAD (general anxiety disorder) since 2015 when I was officially diagnosed with it. I only recently (mid 2020) started taking meds for it which was Prozac. The Prozac LITERALLY saved my life and I have never felt better before. I'm thankful I finally took the huge step into starting medication and happy with the results from it.

 My anxiety is basically non existent in my everyday life but the only thing that is still bothering me is this really weird and specific anxiety I get when I'm outdoors. I tend to get really freaked out by large open spaces, especially large streets, intersections, highways, city streets, or walking on a crosswalk. For some reason I just get the biggest rush of anxiety ever to the point where I am pleading to god to please just transport me home. I start manually breathing, manually blinking, and I also start getting vocal ticks where I repeat a certain word over and over again. It feels like a bunch of sensory overload and it's the reason why I barely go outside anymore. I have no idea if there is a specific name for this or if anyone has similar experiences.

so my friends and I had to recreate this photo of us in the younger grades at the library. it looked pretty fun to recreate and my friends and I were so excited to recreate it. my hair was shorter at the time and the computer teacher just took my hair and put it in my bra straps to make it look shorter but I had another idea of taking my bandana and tying the folded hair together so it could look realistic but she said no we have to do it her way in order to make this photo work. everyone in the class kept staring at me because I looked nothing like the photo not even similar. I looked terrible and even my friends knew it. the teacher then said I know I‚Äôm sorry all the money you used to spend on that fake hair. how much money did it take for you to do your hair? I gave her a disgusted look because it was none of her business to know that nor was it her problem to say that in front of the whole class. the whole class laughed at me and I cried in front of them and I stood up for myself to the teacher and told her this is none of your business to know how much it takes to do on my hair. my hair DOESN‚ÄôT nor shouldn‚Äôt concern you and it shouldn‚Äôt be your problem. I walked out of the classroom and went to the bathroom and cried and didn‚Äôt come out until school was over. my friends were aware that I was in the bathroom keep in mind! the one thing that hurt me was that no one came to find me and I was just all alone embarrassed by the ENTIRE class. I can‚Äôt go to school monday since everyone would laugh at me. maybe it‚Äôs just me being petty but this really made me mad. no one helped me stand up for myself. only I did and I always help stand up for my friends. ALWAYS no matter who the person is. and for the photo the girls had their hair shorter. the teacher might as well cut their hair off with scissors but her only focus was me. the girls didn‚Äôt have to change anything on them. I was the one to have modifications made by the teacher and everyone laughed. and I think that when something makes me mad, maybe the situation isn‚Äôt good and it was wrong. I told my mom and she‚Äôs emailing the school right now to let them know what happened. I‚Äôm telling you this bc I need your insight. everyone‚Äôs always making comments on my hair and it shouldn‚Äôt concern them. the teacher really brought my self esteem down and it made me not want to wear my hair in braids.

2868,TheBeshCatTree,Helpful Tips!,2,Anxiety,1619231741,"Managing Anxiety and Procrastination as a Perfectionist Anxiety is common among many people, but in particular those who are perfectionists and over-achievers. 

These kinds of people are used to doing everything well and to the best standard, so when something they are unsure about/not great at comes up, they get very anxious. 

This applies to academic life, work life, social life, and more. 

In social situations, when asked to do something new or slightly uncomfortable, these people dread making even the slightest mistake and so are infected with anxiousness. 

The worry of doing something ‚Äòwrong‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô is so overwhelming that often they don‚Äôt even do the task or put it off to a later date. This is also why these kinds of people are often guilty of procrastination (myself included). 

These ‚Äòperfectionists‚Äô won‚Äôt want to do something if they don‚Äôt know *how* to do it, or more accurately, don‚Äôt think they will do well. This leads to procrastination, anxiety, and an overall worse state of mental health.

To try and overcome these challenges, we must accept the fact that we can‚Äôt be great at everything ‚Äì being bad at something is what will make us better at it **next time.** 

So when there‚Äôs a task you have to do and you feel like you really don‚Äôt want to... just do it! Most of the time, the task is so easy you‚Äôll feel silly for stressing about it so much. But if that‚Äôs not the case - Just Do it imperfectly**.** I know it doesn't sound nice at all, but trust me, doing it and not getting it 100% right is always, **always** better than not doing it and causing yourself all that worry.

Leaving ‚Äòscary‚Äô tasks undone can cause a lot of anxiety and stress, which is why getting them out of the way is the best way to help reduce this. 

If this helped you in any way, please let me know! I'm just a guy trying to help people be happier, and if this did, I'd love to hear it :)"

2882,sleep_like_the_dead,Discussion,0,Anxiety,1619225303,"Nature and nurture Here's another topic to discuss: the relative impacts of nature and nurture in mental health disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

All of us GAD sufferers know and understand the difference between normal, healthy stress, and bouts of anxiety where physical symptoms stay for weeks or months due to a chemical imbalance in the mind. However a lot of the time, speaking to people who don't suffer from mental health issues, I sort of feel from their comments, that they automatically feel like the reason they don't suffer from mental health issues is because they have a better psychology that makes them more resilient. 

It makes me wonder how much of the difference between mental health sufferers and the lucky ones that don't have these disorders is due to nature (natural chemical balance in the mind, the mind's ability to heal itself etc) vs how much is due to psychology (nurture: this can be changed). No one gets through a lifetime without experiencing some nasty shit, but my gut feel is that there is a large proportion of the population that can get through it without slipping into depression / severe anxiety, not because of healthier lifestyles or a better psychology, but because of their mind's ability to simply heal itself, or move on from bad situations. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, out of the millions of soldiers and civilians that experience combat situations at war, everyone will keep horrible memories from what they've seen, but some won't develop PTSD, while others will. to me that's simply the luck of the draw. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the nurture side can be immensely powerful: CBT, ACT and other forms of therapy help people overcome and heal their mental health problems. I think one extreme is that of a Buddhist monk who set himself on fire as a protest against the government, and sat in a meditating pose without letting out a single sound or movement. In fact I'd go as far as saying that mental health sufferers that have gone to therapy likely have a more resilient psychology - but they can still be let down by a chemical imbalance triggered by things out of their control, which requires more work to get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think deep down I am still a bit jealous of people who get through life without experiencing mental health disorders. When I see some of my friends who go to 5 day festivals, smash a truck load of powerful stimulants and barely sleep, and then get back to feeling normal within 3 days when they stop... How...

&amp;#x200B;

I do not like last minute plans. I just don't. If I could stay home all the time I absolutely would. Things like work that are scheduled, or chores like going to the grocery store, are fine. Perfect. I know when they are happening and it doesn't cause a problem. But today, my fiance burst through our front door, beyond excited, that there was a car meet happening less than 10min away. He has a Camaro and LOVES cars. He was practically jumping in his excitement to go and see all those cool loud ass cars. 

Naturally he wanted me to go to. My anxiety immediately sets in. I had already planned out my evening. Dinner, some anime, then hop on PC and play some Fallout 76. Have a few beers. I'm trying my hardest to keep a smile on my face as I tell him that I'd rather stay home, but that he can go without me. I am 100% okay with that. His face though, that I'm not interested. Ugh. He looked so dissapointed and told me it was okay, we don't have to go. I INSIST he can go with out me. But he refuses. So I tell him if he wants to go we can go. Because in my head, it's not fair that he can't go now just because I don't want to.

We hop in the car and I just feel sick. I wanna cry. We pull into the mall parking lot and there are cars and people EVERYWHERE. I'm trying my hardest to keep it together as he looks for parking. He parks. Gets out. And I'm sitting there frozen for a minute before I insist I'm gonna stay in the car. He gets frustrated and asks why I came if I'm just gonna stay in the car. At this point I can't even talk because if I do I'm gonna cry. So I just shake my head and close the door. He did finally walk off and go look at what he wanted to look at.

Knowing I was gonna get to stay in the car calmed me down immensely. I happily sat on my phone until he came back 45min later. And I even enjoyed looking at all the pictures he took as he explained what each car was and what had been done to it. But I could tell he was dissapointed to not stay longer. My guilt is horrible. 

I wish my anxiety wasn't like this. Things that should be easy just.. aren't. Does anyone know a way that I can legitimately work on this?

I had panic attacks in the past, controlled them with medicine and therapy briefly.  
Years later I spiraled down on some depression and huge anxiety. I was not happy with my job and carreer, I was not happy with my body and health (got obese), not happy with myself and my life generally. I sought help again, it helped but generally it took time for me to change little bits of my life and improve myself on these. It was simple, to get rid of the anxiety, I had to do things like exercise, eat better, organize myself, and the results would bring be joy and a sense of growth and anxiety would be over.  
  
However, I developed Somatic Symptom disorder. I started by fearing for my health, and the fear of death. I was never too religious, although I am sensitive and believe in spirituality, but was very lost and afraid of nothingness, of dying (I like to live and want to live a lot). So, with an obese body, I started panicking I could have heart issues, blood flow issues, high pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, anything. I used to go to doctors, do blood tests, they were like ""you don't have anything, you're not in a good place but it totally recoverable if you start now"". That was comforting, but it didn't last long for someone with anxiety. I just procrastinated all I should do, and that made me more and more anxious.  
  
One day I had a very bad sinusitis after a brief rhinitis allergy (I have them a lot), it made the pressure on my head and nasal passages that I pressed my skin seeking relief, and it left red stains on the skin like I was hurt, like a little blood leak. I went to the doctor, the stain was gone but I was too worried. She gave me something for the sinusitis and some exams to check the stain. In between these tasks, one day I went to bad and I just felt my heart on my right ear. It fucked me up, later I discovered it is pulsatile tinnitus, but my doctor said it was due to anxiety. In the internet, anxiety can increase it for sure but usually it is caused by something else, high pressure, blood flow issues, so on. Easy to say, I panicked again.  
  
In summary, I did all tests with this doctor and all was good with blood, my ear, even a headscan. She didnt want to investigate further the tinitus. I also went to a heart doc, did a lot of exames and although my pressure was usually a little bit high when seeing him, the 24h exam didnt show I had it. My cholesterol was high, but again, things that if I exercized and ate better should get better. He also didn't do much about the tinnitus.  
  
Those exams made me feel better, and after some time ny pulsatile tinnitus was mostly gone for around 3 months I guess. I was happy! But then, it came back. I believe it was when Covid was starting to hit the world, not sure if it was because of it or other stuff. Because of Covid, I didnt exercise as I got isolated and didnt eat well too.  
  
Well, if you know me well after all this, you probably know that I didn't handle covid well. I isolated myself for a year but although very careful, I used to see family, close friends once a month (not large group, just one or two) and so on. But here in Brazil the P1 variant appeared, my dad got covid and almost died of a blood clot caused by it, and the variant started to fill up hospitals and what was 50% of young people from 20 to 50 at ICUs, now with the varient is almost 70%. Cases of 20 to 29 increased more then 1000% since february, deaths around 400-600%.  
  
In the meantime, I found the love of my life, got promoted at my job, bought a newer car. Awesome things are happening in my life. But the fear of getting sick of covid, needing to go to the hospital, maybe incubating, dying of it. The percentages, the risks, the cases you see online of young guys with no risk factos dying. Oh, he was so good, unfair. Fuck, my mind just think of the worst all the time. Vaccines will take longer here, still months away to get one, and not the best ones. The cases and deaths and damned hospitals will persist. Chaos. Me and my GF trying our best to isolate but sometimes I have leave and do something on the street and just fear and fear getting it.  
  
More recently, I decided to go back to therapy. I also am eating better, exercizing, lost 10kg in 3 months. Im medidating before sleep everyday, and trying my best. Still have a lot of things to try to treat my anxiety but one step at a time.  
  
HOWEVER, recently one day after eating at home after the last bite I felt like a rice grain got stuck on my throat. I spent the whole day and night fighting it, dreading it, panicking. It was the day I had therapy, so I took an anti-allergent, drank a hot tea and went. I stopped feeling it. Thought it was gone.  
Nope, it comes from time to time now.  
  
I hate this somatic symptoms. First, because they are physical. Yeah they appear when Im anxious, but they exist and it is fucked up. I know it is 95% anxiety related and treating it will get resolved, but the 5% makes me want to go to the doctor check if it is not something bad. But, I dont want to go to doctors while Covid is around. Aaaahhh...  
The tinnitus is also strong lately. It is also something that comes up with anxiety but seems to always, physically be there waiting for me to get stressed and reappear. I also want to investigate it to see if it could be bad or if can be treated aside from the anxiety thing.  
  
Other times, chest pain. Muscle pain. Back pain. Jaw pain. Sleeping Bruxism. The list goes on and on...  
  
  
And the worst is that I know all of these probably are just anxiety related, that I am healthy, young, that if Covid hit me I still have like 95%+ chance of not dying (still fear of getting bad symptoms, long covid symptoms), that all is good and it will be. Doesnt do much, general anxiety is still there and making me feel ill all the time and fearing for my health.  
  
I was the kind of always positive guy, that always look for the positive side. But with my anxiety and health, I can just think of the worst and it is tiring.  
  
Sorry for the long text, I just needed to vent.  
  
I know it will get better. I will practice exercize more, eat better, medidate more, search for other things to helo my anxiety. Will keep protecting myself from Covid, waiting for a vaccine. Will enjoy my good life too. And will go to doctors in the future for checkups to make me feel better too.  
  
Live you all, hold on tight!"

2891,sleep_like_the_dead,Venting,1,Anxiety,1619223607,"Frustration at the actual word 'anxiety' So I've been listening to a few tedx talks recently and in one of them the speaker opens up with a very good point: it's frustrating that we use the term anxiety for everything including very minor discomforts in life, all the way  the worst forms of symptomatic stress some of us suffer under GAD for example. Essentially, I feel like one of the side effects of our (welcomed) focus on mental health is that people that do not have (and have never had) a mental health ***disorder*** seem to think they are in the same boat as people who suffer from actual disorders. For example, many seem to think that feeling down (which is completely normal after a breakup or dealing with grief) is the same as being depressed, and that temporary stress is on par with a general anxiety disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they mean well, but I think this sort of makes it worse for mental health sufferers. For example, when I try to open up about the way I feel, I often get comments such as ""don't think about it"", ""just come out with us and get blind drunk, it'll take your mind off it"", ""have you tried a banana / hot bath / chamomile before bed"". These all tend to make me feel worse by reminding me that some people are really lucky to get through life without feeling as bad as I do, and that these people just don't understand how I feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is great that our society now puts a focus on mental health issues, but one of the downsides to me is now the overuse of some of these medical terms, which can, in turn, lessen their power / meaningfulness in the eyes of people."

situation: my family left town for a trip for about a week (i stay home to watch my cat, dog and bc camping causes intense anxiety for me).

context as to why im having trouble managing: My grandma was a hoarder. After my grandpa died, we moved into her place after spending about a year (my sense of time is awful it was def more than 6 months) remodeling it. the hoard is mostly managed but now theres bins of stuff from our old house that we just haven't had a chance to unpack. I usually use my alone time with the fam out of town to clean and sort things (my brother gets obnoxious when i try to do anything or clean anything and just,,, doesn't? idk thats a different issue for another day,) but every room is just kind of,,,,,,,, awful? Ive tried to chip at it but i see 0 progress after hours of sorting things, condensing things and moving things. 

This is discouraging but usually im good at buckling into a flow and figuring things out but this time around I'm feel almost paralyzed by my anxiety. Doing things, changing things, and moving things overwhelms me and makes me anxious - or at least the thought of those things.

I dont know why im feeling like this or what to do really. I'm medicated for anxiety among other things and usually do pretty good. i think my family just left at a bad time for me and mixing in gender dysphoria isn't helping.

I would like to share my experience thusfar with the community since I believe it would be useful to many who were in the same boat as me before taking a med. I will make this as transparent and objective as possible, since that is something I wish I had seen in my research beforehand. This will be a long read. Remember that this is still a sample size of 1, so still take my experience with a grain of salt.   

**Some context (you can skip this if you'd like):** I am 19, and have had anxiety disorders for most of my life and likely ADHD for all of it. In 2017, I was diagnosed with chronic panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and general anxiety disorder, after having had my first panic attack followed by fainting at a concert. That was my rock bottom, since I was having panic attacks after that every few minutes during class. I couldn't function. The diagnoses were eye-opening as ever, and my life was starting to make more sense of me. My psychologist recommended me medication a few weeks into treatment, but I didn't want to go for that since I was too afraid. I thought that by changing my habits and taking supplements I could better manage my anxiety.    

I used a strong dosage of melatonin to stop the panic attacks upon falling asleep, which helped me get remission from panic attacks almost all together. I got a Fitbit to track my sleep quality (highly recommend this) and motivate me to maintain a consistent sleep schedule. This really made me aware of my sleeping habits, and I have had my ups and downs with sleep since. I tried to make the time to make myself meals rather than snacking on carbs. I started to practice Buddhism (very good for stress). I made it a priority to drink water regularly. I took Vitamin-D/Calcium supplements for seasonal affective and a 5-HTP compound. These supplements were pretty helpful, and gave me *some* control over my anxiety. I also continued going to concerts and made it a priority to manage the fears that aroused from being in a crowd and what was overall a highly stimulating environment (I like electronic music, those concerts are pretty intense). I would have an extra 5-HTP supplement before the concert which seemed to help me out a lot. The day after, I felt a great sense of relief. Lots of endorphins.    

Come 2019, I'm about to graduate high school, and I attend the same show I went to in 2017, to make up for the fact that my feinting caused some kind of amnesia and I feel like I missed out on a great show. Except this time, I went into the concert alone. It was quite emotional for me, as it marked a major milestone in my battle with anxiety. I had made it very far, but still had work to do. All went well. I felt in peace with everything afterwards. I felt content with myself and the world. By the way, this all came from me. I have never taken any kind of drug in my life.   

Fast forward, I move into college. I go backpacking for 4 days for the hell of it in the blue ridge mountains and have the time of my life. It was exhausting as ever, but made me much more confident. I meet who seems like the girl of my dreams unexpectedly. I am overall much happier with my life than I ever have been before. We save up and go on vacation to Florida on our own, pretty much right at the start of the pandemic. Fast forward a bit more, her and I are put 650 miles apart, with no means of contacting each other. This, coupled with the stress that popped up in a span of a few weeks due to everything closing from the pandemic, lead to high levels of stress and anxiety. I couldn't sleep at night since I thought she was cheating on me. I broke down almost every night and we fought almost every night. **I felt like I had no options left, and was sick of anxiety tearing my life apart and taking people away from me. My only option left was the medication I feared so much.**   

**My experience with Zoloft:**   

**Getting the prescription:** My psychologist referred me to a psychiatrist who evaluated me to confirm my diagnoses, additionally diagnosing me with OCD. He prescribed Zoloft in the end of it, since he mentioned he has had great success with patients in the past. It is one of the most widely used medications. My doctor also said that he hardly saw side effects beyond nausea in the first few days and reduced libido, addressing my fears of the side effects. He titrated the medication: started at 12.5mg for the first 4 days, then bumped up to 25mg.  I decided to go ahead with it. I would pick up my prescription in a week.   

I congratulated myself for taking initiative, but inside, I was still afraid.    

**My fears before taking it:** As a music maker and creative person overall, I was afraid I would become a zombie or something. I wouldn't experience emotions the same anymore. I would have lower standards for myself and be okay with myself doing poorly in life. I would change as a person. I would feint out of fear of taking medication. I would be too drowsy to focus on my day. I would be suicidal. I would not be afraid to commit suicide, especially in those famous first few weeks on the medication. Hell, I was even afraid of orgasms feeling weird or not happening at all. I was also fearing I would forget to take my meds and mess my life up. 

**How I overcame my fears of taking it:** I told myself this was my only option left. I reminded myself that I will never see success stories, since people generally don't go out of their way to post their experience with a medication unless something terrible happened. I also reminded myself that every person's experience will be different. We all have different nature and nurture. I knew I would need a system to keep track of whether or not I took my meds, and a way to remind myself to take it. I downloaded an app ahead of time called Round which is super super simple. Every day you get a notification at whatever time you set to take your med. You just tap the checkmark in the app when you take your med, and you're done.

**The biggest fear I had was becoming a different person, and my initial dreams not coming true.** Almost letting all that time of my life go to waste, in a sense. Here's what I did about it: I lived the remaining days I had with myself before starting the medication like a friend of mine was about to die. I went out and did stuff, treated myself. The night before I took it, I said goodbye to a part of myself. What I was about to do was for the better. The person I would change into is the person I really am, whether I like it right now or not. I told myself I had no other option. 

**Day 1**: Taking my first 12.5mg was a challenge. I was playing Valorant (a game like CSGO) with my gf over facetime, so I would hopefully distract myself from the fear of side effects after taking the med. I had last minute regrets and was not going through with it. She knew what I was going through since I told her about it and what to expect, and was willing to be there to support me. She also knew I was avoiding taking my pill that morning, so she put some pressure on me by getting upset with me that I wasn't taking it and almost two minutes later, I swallowed my fear (and the pill). Within a few minutes, I felt a feeling of doom come over me. Like panic. My hands started going numb and I felt lightheaded. I laid down on my bed for a moment to recenter myself and went back to the game.  

About 30min later, I felt fine. Hours later, I felt at peace with everything around me. I felt like there was no noise in my head. That day, I got tired much earlier than usual (around 9PM) and went to sleep. I woke up a few times during the night, which was unusual. I decided to pass that off as an adjustment to the medication (basically my body saying ""wtf is this??"") and recognized it would go away eventually.     There was no nausea, no drowsiness, no dizziness. 

**Day 2:** Basically a repeat of day 1, but taking the pill was much easier this time. The fear that came after was still there, but I knew how to handle it this time. I noticed my focus on the game today was laser sharp. The inner quiet was also there. That night, I had the same experience in my sleep. Woke up several times, and had some vivid dreams. Again, there was no nausea, no drowsiness, no dizziness. 

**Day 3:** Had to get labs done that day (needles are still scary to me). Same as the previous days happened, with less fear after taking the pill. This day, I felt a little drowsy in the afternoon. That night, my sleep improved a little bit. 

**Day 7:** My dosage went up to 25mg, and I experienced some fear the day I took my first 25mg. But that was short lived and I was back on my usual course. Still no noticeable side effects outside what has already happened. The inner quietness sensation (which was just a rush of endorphins after taking the pill) disappeared. 

**Day 10:** I lose motivation to do anything during the afternoon. I remember spending 3 hours laying in the back of my car outside staring at my phone, doing nothing.   

**Day 14:** The loss of motivation seemed to still happen, although it was becoming more manageable. If I ever felt depressed or upset, spending time outside generally helped put that to ease. I talked to my doctor about the depression-like symptoms and he recommended the dosage goes up to 37.5mg, since an increase typically fixes that issue. 

**One month:** I was still feeling depressed here and there, and talked to my doctor. He recommended upping the dosage again. My psychologist also recommended doing so, as 50mg is the minimum therapeutic level (the point when people experience remission) for Zoloft. I figured I would allow myself more time to adjust to the medication and held off. At this point I also had to drive 650 miles to move into my university. My sleep quality returned to normal at this point and overall I noticed I was calmer with handling stressful situations or serious conversations. I had a few days when I was questioning myself and thinking about what life would be like for people without me. The first month, I also had less of an appetite but had to force myself to eat. My constipation issues (that I thought were linked to anxiety) have lightened up a little bit.

**Two months:** I started the 50mg dosage a few weeks after arriving at my university, and didn't feel much of a difference. The passive-suicidal days were less, but still occur. Constipation hasn't gone away, contrary to what I expected. The appetite is back to normal, and I can eat when hungry. I was more willing to do social things and noticed I was making more meaningful friendships, and people seemed to want to be around me more. My girlfriend notes I am not as emotional as I used to be, which is a good thing. In other words, I have my emotions under control. Having conversations with my parents over the phone is much easier. I no longer feel frustrated, upset, worried, etc. after doing so. Previously there were times when I would break down and cry after having conversations, just due to the stress they put on me. I have changed my plans for the future and realized I am capable of doing more. I plan to try to transfer to a much better university since the one I am at now isn't challenging enough. I am reading a lot more. I am also planning on applying to internships and doing a research publication before I transfer out. So what if I fail? I am much better off getting myself into the real world instead of trying to sharpen a sword I never use!

The biggest challenge I have had to overcome was a lack of motivation to do school work and procrastination. My life was a little more disorganized that I was used to. This is likely due to the fact that I am missing some of the fear I was driven by, and overall I'm not as worried. Getting my life back in shape requires a lot of conscious effort now, but I know habits will turn into subconscious actions as long as I am consistent.   

**As of today,** I haven't had a passive suicidal thought for a while. I'm not as afraid of failure as I used to be. I have gotten my time management in order and learned to get back into good habits.  I have realized I need to exercise, drink water, and have a better diet in order to alleviate the constipation I still experience. I have also sought out to get an updated ADHD diagnosis as I am seeing that to be more of a challenge in my life now. My relationship with my girlfriend is healthy. My long difficult relationship with my parents is steadily improving. I have true friends for the first time in my life. I am pursuing more challenging things. My spending habits are a little worse, but I think that is analogous to my time-management skills, in the sense that I have to re-train those skills now that the fear isn't as big of a motivator. I feel more content. I don't go down the rabbit hole anymore if I am upset, I usually cry it out for 5 minutes and I feel better. I have caught myself asking myself ""is this what life is like for normal people?"" on several occasions. **Overall, I have seen dramatic improvement in my life. I have new challenges I have to overcome, and have discovered a lot about myself and my past since starting the medication. While I do not experience emotions to the heights that I used to, I am happier overall. I feel like I am in control of myself.** There are some challenges to overcome along the way in terms of adjusting to the medication, but that is the key to truly seeing a change in your life. What you do in the first few months is crucial to setting the right pace.

**My recommendation:** find yourself a compassionate psychiatrist to guide you through this scary process. Take stories like mine with a grain of salt, whether good or bad. You are your own person, and have different needs and chemistry. You have different nature and nurture. Don't fear the pill. Your doctor is there to guide you. Mine answers texts within 5 minutes and has been very helpful during this whole process. A good doctor should titrate your dosage, and take it little by little. Stay away from any that don't, since that's when the horror stories and serious side effects appear!   

Anyway, hope this helps some of you. I am thinking I will post a toolkit in the coming days for all things that have helped me through my anxiety journey that may be of use to you. I may even start a Medium blog and post stuff about anxiety there.   

Good luck in your journey, even though it feels impossible to move on sometimes, I can personally say that your feelings are wrong about that! **You got this!**"

I know people that still have birthday parties with 20 to 30 people with no distancing, no masks, no nothing and it it sooo angering to me, almost went off on a friend for being careless and I am wondering if I am exaggerating.

Some of those people have had covid this summer and they mock it, laugh at the subject and are amused at the fact that they had it and they think they are invincible now.

It is so simple to just wear a mask, sanitize and keep distance and I am feeling like I am being mocked for being a decent human and doing those and telling other people to do it.

I constantly see people without masks in groups of 10 to 15 people, they are not bothered at all. I hate it so much. I am so scared for my health. Even though I take all precautions, if everybody else isn't then I'm screwed.


The last straw was when my friend told me she's going to a birthday party and I saw stories on instagram from it and there were people just crowded in a circle (seemed like there were 20 to 30 people there)  singing happy birthday and dancing and not giving a shit there's a pandemic going around.

He's helped me make great strides to get out of my shell and to try and make progress towards being less anxious and more confident. Recently though, our closeness has gotten to be weird. Our friendship isn't really just like we're being bros or anything, it's more like we're in a relationship of sorts. We have ups and downs, fights and make-ups, arguments and wholesome moments like we are a couple.

The reason I bring this up is that I get extremely anxious and to an extent even somewhat possessive of him. I take that word a bit too far since it exaggerates the situation but it's better if I explain it a bit more. I'm in college now, my freshman year, and he's about an hour and a half away back home. Obviously he does things to socialize without me (socially distanced and all that pandemic stuff blah blah) but when he does, especially if he's doing something big and major like hanging with a girl or drinking (it's illegal and we're teenagers idk what you expect) and I know that he's allowed to do that and that it's perfectly normal. I get extreme FOMO (fear of missing out) when he does though and I don't know how to act. I shake and panic and get anxious just knowing that he's doing stuff without me because I feel like I'll be left behind. Any social interaction I have is with him. College has been pretty lonely due to COVID stuff and it's been hard to break out of my shell with all that especially that my friend isn't here. I know it's bad for me to feel this way and I know it's bad for me to think that but I wanna be less anxious and I wanna be more social. It's just hard and I'm not sure what to do.

2939,annah1994,Advice Needed,1,Anxiety,1601125066,"Anxiety triggered from dad's operation So let me start off saying I've never had problems with anxiety growing up, this is a fairly recent development. December last year my dad had to go in for a heart operation to fix a bi cuspid aortic valve defect he's had since birth. During this time my family and I were extremely stressed and worried as heart operations are usually fairly risky procedures and he's in his 60s now. Thankfully the op went fine but he had to stay in hospital a few weeks after as he got an infection and told us he could have died when he came out the op as nurses had to immediately fit a pacemaker as his Bpm was too low. Seeing him in the ICU in terrible condition and with a huge scar on his chest really disturbed me and he had many breakdowns during his recovery where he thought he couldn't make it.
I know it sounds selfish but I believe this is a big part of what triggered my anxiety. Since this time, I have become extremely paranoid that I also have this defect and that my heart is beating too quick/slow. I also started a new job back in April but could only stay a few months as it made my anxiety worse to the point where I had to take beta blockers. I also had my second ever panic attack in January whilst I was smoking weed with my boyfriend and it was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life where I genuinely thought I was going to die. Since then, almost everytime I smoke weed now I get panic attacks so I now hardly ever smoke. I have tried online therapy but it didn't really help, so I'm feeling a bit lost.

2948,WhatsTheDealWithBats,Work/School,6,Anxiety,1601117477,"I don't know if I can deal with work... Hey everyone. So I recently started a new job. It's a work from home (for now at least) call center job. I've only been on the phones alone for about 10 days now and things were going okay... Until recently. The changed my script on my and now they expect me to flat out repeat parts of the script as a ""rebuttal"" and want to me to be more pushy with the new script they provided. Like after they say no I am supposed to just ask if I have their permission to enroll them into some monthly charge. That's how they want me to end that situation. And people just take it bad and get super mad. ""I ALREADY TOLD YOU NO!"" 

Or when they say they don't want the program first thing in the call I still have to read the whole script and get 2 more ""no""s and it just makes people mad when I am forced to ask them 2 times. ""I DON'T WANT YOUR FUCKING PROGRAM. STOP ASKING!"" It drives my anxiety off the wall. And if I don't get 2 full ""no""s I get it counted against me.

I tried to do this on the first day they told me and got so many people yelling at me and getting mad at me...I can't do this. Each time I get yelled at ever fiber of my being wants to run away. I can't really deal with confrontation. My anxiety just isn't cut out for it. Everyone keeps telling me to just deal with it. That these people will never see you. Why should you care. Let them get mad. And ect. But idk. My anxiety is going nuts and I dread working now. 

All of my being wants to just quit. That I am not cut out for this. The script they want me to read just makes people mad. But if I quit then I make the person who referred me look bad. Plus it's my first job in years and with COVID I am lucky to have one and I am not sure if I could find another at the moment. So I have no freaking clue what to do.

My biggest problem is that I overthink what other people think of me and how I should have done things differently when it comes to social interactions. 
Couple days ago I had to take a day free from work to be with my 2 year old daughter who had a cold and couldn‚Äôt go to kindergarten. I was so nervous to make a call and tell them I can‚Äôt come. I was thinking about how disappointed my coworkers will be and that they will talk badly about me, even though everybody at work are extremely nice and I feel very comfortable there, I had extremely negative thoughts... 

The next issue is even bigger. It‚Äôs my relationship. I feel so insecure about myself and I‚Äôm always thinking how my partner will eventually find someone better, more fun and interesting than me. We do have communication issues and argues quite a lot. We have nice days, he often tells me that he loves me, but he‚Äôs very confident man and he tells me how he find women attractive when they‚Äôre very confident. Every time when a problem occur between us I distant myself from him and later overthink how he deserves someone better than me. I know it‚Äôs not always my fault, but I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be with him and he would be happy with someone else. 

I haven‚Äôt spoke to my therapist for a month now. This is definitely something I will bring up to her when I book an appointment soon, but is there anyone with similar problem and have any advices? This makes my life so miserable and I feel like I can‚Äôt fully enjoy being with my partner and other people, because I always find myself having negative thoughts that they‚Äôre not completely genuine with me and that deep inside they dislike me.

b) A lack of care for personal hygiene and well-being (unless I'm working).

I‚Äôll start: I‚Äôm 3 years into my journey. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve got a mix of social anxiety and generalised anxiety. 

My biggest problem has been muscle tension, specifically in the form of headaches and stiff neck. I do get great benefit from remedial massage (albeit temporary fix) so I decided to try Botox.

Just to note I‚Äôve tried various forms of medication in the past and I‚Äôve found the side effects intolerable and have had counselling.

So I got my forehead and temporalis region done with the smallest dose possible to begin with. Immediately I began to feel the headache shifting. I‚Äôm 1 month in and i can safely say it has been surprisingly effective and completely surpassed my expectations. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve had an 80% improvement in symptoms (I do still get quite a stiff neck).

Specifically, my anxiety has become easier to manage. Without a doubt, it‚Äôs still there, but my ability to engage in situations that typically cause me stress has improved.

I'm a very social, bubbly extroverted person who in normal times hosts events of 50-70 people on my house on the regular. Since covid that drastically changed to where I maybe have one conversation a day with a person face to face. I need to work so I'm home but everything is remote and i barely interact with anyone else. This is causing me to have really weird anxiety like I never really had before. 
I start feeling really anxious and like I'm losing my mind. Idk how to describe it but I really want to know if this is an experience other people have. It takes me a very long time to feel normal and like myself again. It might be a bit of dissociation. I suddenly get lost in the worst panicked feeling in the world and I can barely focus on what's happening in front of me. It isn't a typical anxiety attack because I'm not hyperventilating. It goes away slowly if I call someone or do something else to take my mind off it. It's not normal anxiety, I've experienced that before. This is like the worst feeling in the world. 

Anyone recognize what I'm saying? I have a therapist and I'm seeing a psychiatrist but I have to wait a week and it seems like no one understands what it is.

And I honestly feel like I‚Äôm about to go crazy... Does anyone else experience prolonged physical symptoms like this?"

There's been extreme pressure on me to get a job to pay rent/bills and all the necessities of running a home. So I finally was able to get a job because I turned 18, and I start October 12th. I'm really nervous about it. I'm anxious about being clueless in a new environment with absolutely no one I know where I'll be working. And on top of that, my bf's sister who hates my guts works there. I saw her when I went to sign the job offer. It just sucks, I'll be working 12 hr shifts too. It's just scary I guess. I don't trust my body with a 12 hr shift but I have to anyway. I'm also really nervous about meeting people, especially people who have been working longer and know what they're doing while I'll be making so many mistakes.

 This happened a couple of days ago but I‚Äôm still embarrassed of it... 
  So I work in the fast food industry because I am a minor and unable to find better jobs. And because of The C pandemic. it‚Äôs made our jobs a lot harder. The biggest issues as been our ‚Äúno contact‚Äù policy, which involves bucket. We have to hang out food and change in buckets so we don‚Äôt spread germs ( we clean the buckets if someone touches them ). 
   Well a lot of people hate digging out their change from the bucket. Which I understand, it‚Äôs annoying for me too. So I try to make it easier for them. I stand up the bills and tip the change into their hand. However people still complain and try to snatch the bucket from me( I‚Äôm not allowed to let go.) 
    Well that all that explained, I was working the other day. And our card reader was down so we were only accepting cash. Everything was going smoothly until this entitled jerk comes through. She asked me to put her change into a napkin and hand it to her. I misunderstood her so I rapped up her change and put it into the change bucket. She made that annoyed tongue sound and said ‚Äú I asked you to hand it to me‚Äù. Which I replied to‚Äù oh I‚Äôm sorry ms. I didn‚Äôt understand your request but I‚Äôm not allowed to hand it to you anyway. It‚Äôs company policy‚Äù. I handed her food out and she started to yell at me about being a bad service champion. She took a slight break so I assumed she was done, so I closed the window and went to work on the next order. When I turned back to the window she was still sitting there. I opened the window back up and asked‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry did we forget some of your order?‚Äù And she asked ‚Äú no but do you think it‚Äôs appropriate to close the window on customers faces?‚Äù I said‚Äù oh I‚Äôm sorry I thought you were finished.‚Äù And she said a few other thing. Then said she was going to call my manger and have her teach me proper customer service. She drove off and I told my coworker and manger on shift what happened. They said they normally don‚Äôt call so I shouldn‚Äôt worry. So I was feeling down but I went back to handing out orders. 

This is where it gets worse.
15 minutes goes by and my coworker comes rushing next to me and says‚Äù that customers did call!!‚Äù And I asked‚Äù well what did __mangers on shifts name__ day?‚Äù And my coworker said‚Äù she‚Äôs going to write you up‚Äù and my manger walked in as she said this. As soon as I processed what she said I broke down. I started crying about getting written up. And my coworker tried to explain it was a joke and how everyone here knows I wouldn‚Äôt be intentionally rude to a customer.( apparently everyone there thinks I‚Äôm the nicest. I also gets the most tips) and how it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Well they suggested I take a break and drink some water. But I said I‚Äôm fine and started handing out orders again. Then my breaths started getting rushed and heavy and this feeling of extreme panic I can‚Äôt describe settles over me. Which I know now to associate to right before I have a panic attack. My coworker who made the joke asked if I was alright and I said yeah I‚Äôm fine I‚Äôm just having allergies. I did my coping mechanisms and avoided the panic attack building up. 

Sorry if my story didn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôm scattered brained and been out school too long lol but yeah that sucked and now i have anxiety about going back to work.

2999,pungen,Work/School,3,Anxiety,1601091890,"Self-employed - compelling yourself to work with anxiety Apologies if this has already been covered, I found some tangentially related topics when searching but nothing exact. 

My life is a bit of a dumpster fire right now, unrelated, and my anxiety is at max. I'm self-employed. Sometimes I have weeks where I don't have that much work but everything I do have is complete drudgery; this lack of stimulating work or pressing deadlines means I spend countless hours at the computer not making progress and then I feel anxious about it, head into avoidance, etc. 

At the moment I'm at an intersection of dumpster fire life and this work situation and man, I am just failing. Opening emails, painful. Bringing myself to do a single task, painful. I will clean every dish and floorboard in this house gladly but my work is like a scary movie I'm trying not to look at.

Anyone have any tips on how I can force myself to do better on work? I can't keep doing this without negatively impacting my clients, but with everything else bad happening in my life, any sort of positive thinking is straight up unappealing and I'm not sure how else to approach it. So looking for advice that doesn't involve being cheery.

Thank you much, internet strangers."
