6,Garnetjen118,Advice,21,writing,1609837992,"I Can't Write my Story because of Trauma...Should I Scrap It? In season 6 of Netflix's animated show, ""Bojack Horseman"" there is an episode titled ""Good Damage"" where one of the lead characters, Diane, attempts to write a book about her life but is stuck in a serious case of writer's block. Not only that, but when she tries to focus on her writing she is bombarded with her past trauma and finds it impossible to complete her book when she is still confronting these awful memories. However, she still tries to push past the pain because she feels that if she doesn't write about her past, then all of the suffering she went through would be for nothing.

Why does this matter? Because, if you have seen that episode then you already have a great idea of how I feel about my own story. 

I'm not confident that I will even finish my book. It's simply too hard...

I'm trying to make an autobiography about a year in my life spent in Japan, but as I write, it constantly brings up hard memories that I'd rather forget. It isn't easy to focus on my work because I get thrown back into trauma. 

I think about it so often because I find it necessary to talk about those moments in order to create a compelling story. I can't pretend I was a perfect human with no flaws and no hardships; there was a lot of issues I had to overcome.

I get upset with myself a lot for still letting it control me because it really isn't as bad as I'm making it sound. It's mostly the bullying I've faced in my school years that lasted from preschool all the way to university. There are other people in my situation who need a voice to express that things will be okay in the end, but at this point, I don't think that voice will end up being me.

It feels like a lose-lose situation. If I continue on with my story, I will no doubt have to write about these difficult moments in my life and I'll have to accept that these problems will be viewed by people worldwide and I don't know if I'm ready for that. Yet, if I stop writing then I'm letting my trauma overpower me and I'm depriving people like myself of an outlet to find comfort in, to prove that they are not alone.

Should I pursue my story even though it reminds me of my trauma or should I just stop writing it altogether? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Please be kind in the comments."

11,Maerika17,Advice,8,writing,1609836595,"Should I sign on with this site? Sorry for long post So I’m writing a book and wanted to wait until I was done to post it, as I tend to be a ‘in the moment’ writer, meaning I start with an idea, name the characters, and start writing.  This also means as time goes on things change as the story develops and I need to go back and make changes to keep things consistent. Idk if that made sense, but it’s how I am.  If I sit down and try to plan it out, I just lose interest. 

Well, I write on Wattpad, typically.  Its just what I’ve used since high school and it’s easy to use, so I do.  I decided to post my story’s prologue to stir interest and see if it’s something people want to read.  Well, apparently an author liason representative liked it and reached out to offer it to be posted on their site (Webnovel, for anyone curious) where I could make some profit from my book.  

I don’t know if I want to do it, because this story has been with me for 4 years (I actually completed it at one point in high school, but it wasn’t great and was all over the damn place) and I even turned it into a fanfiction at one point (no judgement, please lol) I started it junior year of high school and I’m now 22.  So I care about this story and don’t want to just sign it away.  
  The contracts offered would both give me 50% of profits, and with one of the contract options I can’t post it anywhere else but the site would market my book and I’d have professional editors to help (royalty contract) The other they wouldn’t market it and I’d just get 50% of the profits, but I’d be able to post it wherever I wanted and still have full rights to the story (non exclusive contract)  It feels like a great chance to get my name out there, but at the same time I’m skeptical. 

What would you do in my position? If you need any extra info just ask and I’ll provide it."

16,CaroAurelia, ,0,writing,1609832664,"Nothing is New Under the Sun: Why It's Okay if Your WIP Bears a Passing Resemblance to An Existing Piece I'll use real-world examples to illustrate my point.

I recently watched a show called The Flight Attendant. In the first episode it reminded me a bit of a gender-swapped version of my favorite show, The Night Of. In both shows, the protagonist gets lit and has a one night stand with an attractive stranger. The protagonist wakes up the next morning to find the stranger brutally murdered. Scared and realizing how it looks, they run. They're pretty sure they didn't commit the murder, but they're too fucked up to remember what happened. They quickly become suspect number one.

Sounds like the exact same show, right?

Wrong.

By episode 2, the shows quickly take different paths. The circumstances of the murders are totally different. The tone is different. The themes are different. The tone is different. It's as though two writers were given the same prompt and both ran with it, but in completely different directions.

The important thing is not whether your idea is completely original, totally unique, never-been-done-before, because that's pretty much impossible at this point. The important thing is that you take your idea and put your own spin on it. That you write it the way only you can."

(I absolutely hate making cheery stories as they are very boring.) Title suggestions would be appreciated. (NSFW for mention of suicide)  

“Who cares what they think anyway?” Those were his last words before his decision. The type of sentence that makes you think it would be ironic if you knew the story. But you don’t. Not yet anyway. The kid took little amount of pride in his accomplishments because that was all he could do, he was shy and timid. The guy who would be there for someone just for the sake of maybe just maybe being able to connect with someone. But being kind didn’t mean he was cool. It just meant he was prey. A side eyed slab of meat, blind spots and could not look forward without turning away. He was as still as a lake with children on every beach in proximity. Trying to calm himself after every pitiful remark that was thrust towards him. Becoming more and more shallow as time went on. You see, nothing ever works out the way you want it too. Everyone and everything plays some sort of part in someone's life, or their unfortunate demise. The kid would take strolls through the hall dodging landmines and bullets. How else would he get back to home base alive? The only place he felt at peace with and how pitiful that there was only that limited time he could stay before it would crumble and he would have to retreat into the depths of the world he felt so sharp and cold about. It was as if he was a puppet being controlled by another force that had no power over him but it was all it needed. He was controlling himself based on the stuff going on at the court. He didn’t get the ball, the spot on the team he so desperately wanted, the satisfaction of being on the squad everyone chanted for and he never got the choice to do anything about it. He wanted to scream for help but his lungs were barely keeping him alive, His legs weren’t supported by his only lifeline, his face was red from anger and sadness, sweating and trying to hold on to what he wanted so desirably. The thought of having something worth fighting for, but he didn’t. He wasn’t strong enough and that was okay. Seconds pass as a red liquid poured from his hands on fire. To think just having the clarity of who he was could have saved him, having the little amount of hope that could bring him back to his feet. But he was sending his message in the only way he knew fit. And with his heavy breathing he could barely mumble the words that changed everything: “I cared.” And as his lifeless body hanged from the ceiling of his safe space that protected him for so long yet such a little amount of time. I had escaped."

20,paws-for-effect, ,7,writing,1609829241,"I know what my story is about but I can’t find the right beginning I’ve had this one story idea for a very long time now and I’ve finally gotten to a place in my life where I have the time and the motivation to actually start putting things on paper.

I have my setting, and I have a handful of characters who I’ve been slowly creating in my head for a long time. I know some major plot points I want to get to, as well as some ideas for character arcs and B-plots.

The only problem — the only roadblock — is that I can’t for the life of me figure out where to start and get things going. Every time I begin writing, it just doesn’t feel right. I know much of this is probably due to the fact that because I have been mentally building up this world for so long, my expectations for it are pretty high and I want to do it justice.

I just don’t know where to start writing and translating my mental image of everything into a coherent story, or what sort of opening will make sense. It’s sort of quasi-fantasy in that it’s set in a realistic modern-day world with a few supernatural elements sprinkled in.

Does anybody have any sort of advice regarding figuring out where to start a story? (Not specifics of course because I’m not asking anybody to give me story ideas, I just mean advice for writing processes and the like). Do you have any particular things you do to help you figure this out?"

So the main antagonistic in a story I want to write is a king from a dead race destroyed by a god but he managed to escape and survive by acting human and eventually become king.  He wants revenge on the God that destroyed his people (the destruction wass mostly justified), but I wanted him to have gotten so deep into his human role that he has forgotten most of his past from that race and his grudge becoming a benevolent king over the tyrant he used to be.

And as the story progresses he would find more and more clues about his past that would gradually change him from the benevolent human king everyone's gotten to know to a vengeful tyrant hell bent on destroying the gods.

Hey internet! So, uh, i was creating an undertale alternate universe. (Yeah, undertale is still a thing) 

So, my main character is an arrogant, cold monster who works for a criminal organization after emerging from the underground. He kills. Not because he wants control, or even money. He simply kills when his advisers tell him to, or he feels right. 

I find it odd, since I watch a lot of true crime and I never sympathize with the killers. My knee jerk reaction is literally ew, ew, dirty gubby poop man (or woman) towards a real killer's actions. 

But whenever I think about my character I actually dont really care about the victims or the morality of his actions. He doesn't care either. He doesnt care about the people he killed, only about the well being of the organization. to him, that is enough. 

So, I read a few other posts around reddit, and many said that there must some other reason that the reader sympathizes with the character. Well, this dude is pretty laid back, lazy and generally liked by everyone. can you guess who he's based off of?...) the reason he is able to go around robbing banks and all is because he was a witness to a murder, and he absorbed a human soul and was thrown in prison. He was convicted him for something he didnt do, and seeks revenge on those who wronged him.  (not gonna go into detail, but human souls are sort of like an elixir of life. When a monster absorbs one they become immortal and can come back when they want to)

Their emotions are taken seriously and the heavy weight on the shoulders of a man who must love several women at a time is shown many times. This way, no one can call my story a ""garbage harem"" to the face.

However, I want to take it a little further. I want to make it appealing, even if only slightly, off its target demographic (young males).

The reason I don’t want to keep reading is because I really dislike the main character and find them to be extremely sexist and uninteresting, so far there have been multiple scenes of sexual assault which I found have added almost nothing to the plot, and extreme “all women are dumb and boring” sentiments. I am looking for advice on how to give helpful feedback on this to the author, in a way that isn’t cruel. I don’t want to tell them the majority of their book is bad, but that is really how I am feeling right now. Is it rude to say “sorry but I couldn’t finish it for xyz reason”? I don’t want to crush their spirit and it is someone I see occasionally so I don’t want things to be awkward in the future when we are at the same events, but I truly find the themes and content difficult to get through and if I was reading this from the library or was gifted it, I wouldn’t have made it past the first five chapters. Any tips would be helpful!"

As I meet an early end by the blade of one of my lover’s suitors, she walks into the room in which I was slain, and rushes to my side, but alas, she cannot save me. And so, she turns her newborn rage upon the suitor, and though he has died, she stabs him through the heart a million times over, tearing his heart into twice as many tiny, unreachable pieces, so as to make him feel the pain she felt.

But she was not done. She turns her wrath upon the people, and, though soon all of them were laid to waste, it was not enough.

Without her true love, all life is meaningless. And thus, she takes the sword that has taken so many lives, and plunges it through her own heart. And so, her bloody corpse was up on that one hill, so long that it was a part of that ground by the time people came again.

And to this day, the two of us carry on our love in the stars, but we visit any time anyone climbs that hill. Those that are brave enough seem normal, for a while. But that very night, they wake up with a calling to that hill. They go back, sword in hand, and all those who they see awake along the way are impaled, and their body is carried that the hill. And when they get there, that brave soul will plunge the sword into their own heart. And then their sword will be added to my lover’s collection — as well as their soul.

The main character was too perfect. 

The bad guys were fast but he was faster. His sidekick noticed their target but he was already one step ahead. He still held the Olympic skiing record from 5 years ago an no one has beat it. 

Even when the author throws a curve ball, it bounces off his plot armor like a .22 off an Abrams tank. Something like, the bad guy turned and was holding a gun instead of a knife! Then the badass main character adjusted his attack on the fly and swiftly dispatched his enemy. 

It got old. Real fast. 

I explained it to my wife like James Bond vs Indiana Jones. Bond destroys an enemy airfield and straightens his tie and walks out. While Indy makes it all up as he goes, usually gets punched in the face a lot and narrowly escapes with his life (and hat). 

It’s not really a problem but in the book I was reading it was just so obvious and I realized why it’s important to make hero’s have flaws. I personally don’t write much except for fun when I travel, but this just reaffirmed my thoughts.

Hey, I should start by saying that I found a passion for writing back in April and started a personal project because of it.  I knew from the beginning that this project would be something I would work on long-term (for a couple of years at the very least), and even though I enjoy working on it and planning it out, I still have trouble finding the time and motivation to work on it, and when I do, I'm extraordinarily slow at it. 

At least once a week, I set aside an entire night (give or take 4 or 5 hours) to work on it. In that time span, I'll be lucky to at least add 1k to a chapter.  I know I can do better because in the beginning, I  once managed to get 4.5k down of notes in approximately 5 hours. Yes, these notes were messy bullet points with some of them not even being in the same tense, but I actually got things done that night. Knowing this, I think my perfectionism is the biggest hindrance to being able to get work done, but my motivation also is an issue.

Other than the nights I set aside for writing, I  seem to have trouble finding the time and the motivation to work in periods that aren't large uninterrupted chunks of time. I want to work regularly on it, but school is difficult, and by the time I finish my classes and homework for the day, I'm too tired to write. This and my fluctuating mental health make finding a consistent healthy schedule feel like a chore.  

Whenever I do manage to work, my perfectionism comes in and forces me to try and make my writing as perfect as it can be as soon as it hits the page. Despite knowing these are rough drafts, I constantly search for the right words/similies/sayings, read my writing over and over, and edit things I just put down. I always rethink the scenarios in my head and can't let them flow naturally onto paper. It feels like my mind can't take the idea of putting out something bare/sloppy and then building up from it. My writing needs to be as perfect as it can be at first glance.

Now to sum it up, this character starts off as a thief working for a larger criminal organization while pursuing her own personal agenda and its this goal that brings her into contact with my protagonist. Now while she starts off rather self centered but charming and competent, she wants out of her current situation and to be free of the criminal life.

I know where I want her to end up for the most part but its the meat of that I’m having a bit of trouble with. Now all of my main characters have arcs where they struggle with and confront underlying fears and insecurities and my plan for this character is that she fights with the fear of rejection due to her past deeds. You could also call it a fear of acceptance I guess as growing up in the world of organized crime she has been forced to do things that she isn’t proud of and some that she is directly ashamed of. This has caused her to develop a very low and harsh opinion of herself fearing that no one would actually care for her genuinely and she hides this side of herself behind the mask of a very outgoing and sort of rogueish personality. I envision her character as a big misdirection as at surface level she appears to be the most put together of my main 3 but in reality she is simply internalizing all of her issues.

My question is does this fit with this type of arc or am I completely off base? I know its a really common character flaw but I’m trying to spin a little differently. Also her fear is not exclusive to romantic love but involves her relationships with her friends, other allies, etc."

&gt;Inspired by the rags-to-riches story (a process they call resurrection) of their traveling salesman savior, the Yalgrans believe they have been divinely tasked with letting the galaxy in on the good word about their great deals. It does not matter to them particularly what item is being exchanged, for which purpose, so long as they are participating in the holy sacrament of the sale, hard, soft, or somewhere in between. They are famous for their massive, nested, televisually coordinated sermons in which attendees then preach to ten more converts, who then each preach to ten more converts, and so on, until you could be increasing faith by up to 270%, on a compounded weekly basis, if you join now.

or

&gt;It is a misconception that the Tiyanki die peacefully in the atmosphere before floating gracefully to their final resting place. The truth is much more harrowing, as any Metian knows too well. They would tell you, if they deigned to address outsider scum, that they feel the tortured death rattles of the great beasts in their bones, that the suffering of the universe is an incomprehensible burden to them, that when they look up at the stars they hear nothing but screams. It must all be brought to a close, the death rattles and screams and aching bones, once and for all. Those who celebrate life have condemned us to it, and there will be an end to them, and soon the galaxy will be a peaceful graveyard, the graves like pale sheep, the sheep, the grey pasture.

I am opting this time to not nave a plan as my previous project was planned and that went awful: all other non-planned stories have always gone well and I have enjoyed writing them. A plan is too rigid and restrictive but also I feel the subgenre of space opera should also grant me more freedom. Obviously, Star Wars will be a big influence, though my ideas will be original (or as original as can be). So, my question is, should I continue with the original book (fantasy), or the space opera (I have written 1500 words unedited so far)?"

The story is in first-person POV with the MC/narrator speaking and understanding only English. Two secondary characters, 'A' and 'B' are yelling at each other in Japanese, with the MC overhearing it but not understanding (meaning that logically I can't just write out the yelling in English). I can't have them fight in English because character 'B' only speaks Japanese.

Is there some way I can handle this one scene without breaking the MC's first person POV? Can I switch POV characters to character 'A' for just the one scene? I don't want to use a hack like the MC saying ""later, I found out they said this to each other..."" I'm stumped.

Well, the ways I look for better words fall into these four choosable steps.

1. Google or Thesaurus.
It seems obvious however both are very useful!
Here’s a tip, if a word is to simple or already used in the sentence; let’s say “nice”
On google, type in ‘define nice’ and it will show a list of synonyms and acronyms!

2. Ask friends or family members.
If you can’t find the right word, show your friend or family member your extract and ask them what they think. Even if they’re inexperienced in writing, there’s a good chance they have a wildly different vocabulary to you so they may be able to supply new suggestions that you otherwise wouldn’t have thought of.

3. Leave and come back.
You can perceive this in two ways, if you can’t find the words then work on another piece of writing, otherwise, you could take a complete break and either go for a walk or read.

4. Considering your looking for a descriptive word, imagine your really there. Imagine the atmosphere and think about how your character would describe these words, even if the writing is 3rd person.

But everybody is a mutant/human mutate/metahuman. All the superpowers are scientific. But science can't explain all of the superpowers. Some superpowers are complex. But scientists still have theories and hypotheses on certain superpowers. They are all scientific powers. But again they are genetic powers or altered powers. There two types. The first type is born with superpowers. Because the gene is activated at birth. The second type gets superpowers from accidents and experiments. Because the experiment or accident is resulting in the gene being activated.

But some supernatural powers are tricky for me. Vampires and Werewolves I can explain that easily. Because vampires and werewolves are born with their powers. Gene activated at birth BAM. Sometimes vampires and werewolves aren't born with their powers. They get turned later on in their lives. Gene activated through accidents and experiments Bam.

But the more learnable supernatural powers are hard. Stuff like chakras, chi/ki, magic, spiritual powers. I'm trying to make these powers scientific superpowers. The gene has been in my world for millions of years. I'm trying to use the gene to explain the supernatural powers behind myths, legends, and folklore as individuals with the gene activated. But how can you make learnable powers genetic powers or altered powers? Witches/Wizards or spirit users are not mutants. They are not human mutates. They aren't born with powers. They don't get powers later on in their life. They learn their powers. And the confused me. And I'm struggling to make learnable powers pass as genetic powers or altered powers.

Dr. Strange wasn't born with magic or got bit by a magic spider. He was taught how to use magic.

I'm writing a chapter where the heroes encounter a tried and true literary trope, the Wise Old Man who lives somewhere remote.  When they find him, they and the reader need to learn a lot of backstory, fast (for the Big Bad Guy trope is approaching).  They've been told that Wise Old Man is important, but that's all, so he has to talk for at least a couple pages about the history of this land, how things came to be, and who he *really* is.

Unfortunately, I don't see any way to make this wall of text be anything but a multi-paragraph quotation.  The only alternative I see is having the characters be so shocked, confused, or just plain annoying and chatty that they interrupt every few sentences, which might shake it up but also break the reader's concentration.

Unfortunately, the characters will only meet the Wise Old Man Trope once, and he is the only one who will share The Truth as opposed to the government-approved version of The Truth, so I've got to one-shot this backstory.  (Finding a second Wise Old Man Trope living on the other mountain who knows The Truth is probably not going to happen.)

Fellow writers, if you've had to do this, how have you approached this?

tl;dr = Let the Wise Old Man tell the long story uninterrupted, or try to break it up to keep the reader engaged?"

Wolves helping Pigs 

      “Kitty r u paying attention” ,asked Klawz for the 2nd time .Her eyes looked as if someone glued them to her Yokia tablet. Klawz ave up n just sat there watching facial expressions. Kits expressions ranged wildly from that Yokia tablet one face of terror, a face of shock n one face of excitement. Klawz was shocked when she gave him a wink.

       Klawz got intrigued by her first  successful wink, so he walked over to pull out her headphone jack from the left side of the Yokia tablet. The SCREEN flipped over n Kitty whispered, “check this shit out”. Pigs chasing wolves were the main event for a bit. Cars slammed together swapping paint repeatedly. “Enough of that shit Kitty, one of those sheep just passed by our flat. I’m bored ASF so let join the pigs”, he remarked a bit bored.

       Klawz n Kitty stood up semi-excited as if they have done this a bunch before. Klaws walked over to the tv then threw her the bag containing her outfit within waz just a pair of cat-ears n 2 Yamasaki cat claws. Kitty looked as if she waz a cliche cat. Klawz is always unoriginal. All Klawz did waz pull up his hood n wrap a bandana around his mouth. “Really Klaw, that FUCKING bandana”, said kitty. “Why Not now grab the keys for our fucking Ride”,Klaws aggressively  said back.

     Kit drove the whip as if she was a  bloodthirsty ASF wolf merging in with the pair of pigs. Klaws knocked on the pigs windows saying “Hey, Charlie n Kesh same as usual”. Charlie glanced to Kesh, rolling down the cracked window then looking  back at Klawz plainly saying, “Fuck it why not”.

 “BITCH SLAM THE PEDAL HARD ASF”, he shouted. Kitty gave a slap with her Yamasakis n said, “ U the bitch who can’t even aim a gun”. Klawz looked down with blood dripping to the floor picking up a bloody crowbar from underneath the luxurious seat. That blood-stained crowbar was one of his guns. “Kitty, pull up along side that PIECE OF SHIT  Ford pick-up”, Klawz said with high energy.

     “Yeah whatever says the PUSSY who can’t aim a gun”, mocked Kits. He leapt out of the window jumping into the rear of the PIECE OF SHIT pick-up. “Wazz up Friends”, Klaws said with a smirk while tappin on the glass. The rear window was easily smashed by the blooded crowbar. Blood splattered across the smashed glass n on the front windshield. Klaws  leapt back into the LAMBO window rather sloppy hitting A knee on the door leaving a small dent. “Still a PUSSY”, Kits said jokingly yet semi-serious. 

  Kesh n Charlie n Kitty n Klaws pulled their car to the side of the dirt road n walked into the Dorkin Shop. Dorkin has the best creamy ASF donuts in North Ampton. There coffee is complete n utter shit in comparison to Speedy Chek. “Nasty u drink that garbage still”, Kesh jokingly said to Kits. Kitty choked heavy from his rather basic joke,Kitty tried reaching for Charlie mug of plain water with lemon. Charlie put his hand over his mug, “Nah GURL that is my mug”. Kitty got a little uneasy after recovering from almost dying a bit. That gurl knocked his North Ampton PD mug to the trash floor n said way to loud, “BITCH FUCK UR CHEAP ASF MUG”. The SHADY Dorkins Shop bust out laughing mad hard.

     Klaws could tell she was mad pissed, so he walked over to the cashier n asked for a Creamy ASF donut, pushin a blood stained hundy across the counter.Blood dripped off Franklin’s face onto the counter. The cashier was a bit shocked as she pushed back 99.25, “Just ketchup” he remarked while shovin a Franklin with blood into the tip jar. The donut dripped a bit on the floor as he walked back to the veneer table.Kitty was mad pleased with such a basic ASF gesture.

The shadiest character in the room approached the table of wolves mixed with Pigs. This character placed a calling card on the wooden veneer table hastily writin,give me a call Kitty n Klaw. “Who the fuck waz that”, kitty asked the pigs. Kesh whispered to the wolves, “ ShadE,the local GUN-RUNNER”. That Gun-Runner had a scar on her left albino eye."

Reading On Writing by Steven Kino.

I would love it if the replies could be from people who use writingcirclejerk or bookscirclejerk, which due to their nature and ban-happy mods I cannot ask directly. With that out of the way...

I'm planning a short story in which yellow would be used as a colour motif to symbolize control, or rather, loss of independence, ie, being trapped in an abusive relationship. However, the story is mostly concerned (page-time wise) with supernatural occurrences, and is therefore not a truly good book, or, at least, not in a truly worthwhile genre. (Name a single classic and well-praised book with explicitly magical happenings. No, the works of Bradno Sadno and Miku are not classically praised, no, Christmas carol isn't, no, Lord of the Flies isn't explicit, we could be here all day.) What should I do? The story doesn't really work without the supernatural horror elements, but I feel it would be a disgrace to good authors such as Fitzgerald (yes, he did. Look, if someone is so concerned about detail as to color their curtains, and their work is considered worthy of study and teaching, the blue probably means something.) to use such an idea in a stupid kids genre. Thoughts?"

However, now after finishing the sequel out of a seven-sequel series, I'm wondering if I should just work on the first novel and not waste my time with the sequels. I've been writing this series for 10 years. Took a long time getting to finish the 157-page script for the first book out of what I plan to be seven. The series is so engrossed in my head that I can't not imagine finishing it all, so after writing the first one, I went ahead and wrote the second script that I'll turn into novel. However, after doing some dreaded thinking, I'm wondering if I should not waste my time finishing the other sequels if maybe the first one won't even sell as a novel to publishers or readers.

What if the book doesn't sell though? Does that mean I'll never see these sequels come to light? I don't know. My plan for novelizing the script is to just really get into the characters' heads and go mad into detail and exposition.

What should my plan be here? The problem isn't anymore ""how do I finish?"" because that's the easy part now, but instead when should I start trying to get published? Do I write out the other sequels to make sure I can write the sequels or do I only work on the first book (which is stand alone as it is with potential for sequels and will reach 80-100k words).

However, I got critique from an accomplished published writer that my protagonist strikes as passive. Granted, the author has only read the first chapter, and my protagonist becomes more active later on. He recommended I re-read Great Gatsby for a well-done example of a protagonist-as-observer, so I will do that, but I was wondering if anyone else has struggled with this before, and how to fix it? Make it more interesting? My protagonist does take some actions of her own agency such as proactively helping her paramour achieve things (and artistically expressing herself as a result).

I have tried coming up with some on my own. But, I also think that I don’t know how to write these properly. I have provided some information below about the two characters.

M.C.= Main Character

The Lady with Black Hands (Clara):

Quick description: The lady has ginger hair pulled up into a bun with golden butterfly hair clips scattered over her hair. She wears an A-line scoop, gray chiffon dress. Despite her lovely appearance, it is to be noted that she has black hands. The black stretches like vines halfway up her forearms. She always keeps a thoughtful, warm look. Although, that can quickly change into a face of malice…

Abilities: 

Ability to teleport short distances rapidly, however, long distances require cool down. 

Able to make one see her while making others unable to. (e.g. a little boy sees the lady in the mall by a stand of balloons. He points to her and says “Mommy, mommy, do you see that pretty lady!?” When the mother looks over, she sees nothing besides the balloons. “What lady, sweetie?”)

Ability to leave black hand prints on her surroundings.

Has a deafening scream. (i.e. she can make you go deaf if she screams loud/high enough. In addition to this, it can break her surroundings if she so pleases)

Ability to mess with electronics. (e.g. she can make them turn on and off, glitch out and break them. When breaking them, this means that she can not only damage the exterior, she can damage the interior)

Strengths:

Her abilities do not seem to be limited or affected. 

She can torment people without anyone interfering.

Weakness:

Religious items. (To specify: Religious items do not affect her abilities. They only affect her appearance in said room. For example, she cannot enter a room that is full of religious items for long periods of time. This causes her to usually avoid said room. (religious items tire her out, it drains her energy, her essence) However, she will appear in other rooms more frequently if she avoids specific rooms. 

Why?:

She wants to break Noel down because then she can mold her into what she wants Noel to be… make her do what she wants. She wants Noel to be like her. (Clara is a supernatural being, she wants to recruit Noel.)

With the lady, I am not sure if I should add more absurdity for her. In every post, I have my M.C. mention that the black is spreading further up her arms. What I have her doing right now is scaring my M.C. and breaking things so she will be constantly reprimanded. M.C. didn’t break them, but she wants M.C. to know she is powerless and no one will believe her. What else should she do? Also, how do I have her name mentioned, I don’t know how to implement this?

Formally dressed man (most likely will remain with no name):

Quick description: The man has dark black hair and dresses formally. (I feel I should specify, but I don’t want to be too specific. He wears a black vest, dress pants and shoes and wears a white button up. Should I specify?) His eyes are spirals and he carries a metal golf club. (I feel I should add more absurd features, however, I don’t know what I should add. Suggestions?)

Abilities:

Ability to teleport. (very limited. Unlike the lady, he cannot teleport rapidly or as frequently. He also cannot teleport long distances)

Ability to distort surroundings. (e.g. You walk up the stairs and you are about halfway up. For some reason, you’re back at the bottom of the stairs and you wonder, “How did I get back down here?” However, this ability is also fairly limited. He cannot distort surroundings for long and can only distort one area at a time. Let’s say he is distorting the living room and the bathroom. He cannot distort the rest of the house and his distortions last a short amount of time)

Telekinesis (Again, this is very limited. He cannot do much with it, as in, he cannot haul very heavy objects. He can fling, maybe… a chair, a table and a mug. Things of that weight. A couch would be tricky, but he could make it move)

Ability to make strange sounds. 

Strengths:

Unlike the lady, he is not affected by religious items.

If he cannot use his abilities, (or he’s used them too much and he is tired) he has his metal golf club for use instead. 

He is tall. (6ft, maybe 5’11”)

Weaknesses:

His abilities are very limited as stated above.

He cannot enter rooms if the door is locked. (No, he cannot teleport into a locked room. He just **cannot enter a room if it is locked.**)

Very curious. (This can cause him to become distracted. If he is, my M.C. has a higher chance of getting past him. If he isn’t, he will find her in short of a hot minute)

Why?:

(Unknown. Suggestions appreciated)

What should I make him do? So far he has only had one appearance and he teleported from the bottom to the top of the stairs. He couldn’t enter her room because Noel locked the door.

Edit: I feel the man should have more abilities considering that his are very limited. If you think that I should add more abilities to both the man and the lady, then please make suggestions below. Also I don’t have an explanation for why he can’t enter locked rooms. If you think he should have a name suggest names and how I should implement that in.

Edit 2: The “why?” Is what their reason is for bothering my main character. I need help creating one for the man and maybe change the lady’s."

133,HarleeOST,Advice,20,writing,1606673083,"Writing What You Know In my creative writing workshop course, the professor always encourages that we ""write what we know"". I never found this to be that great of advice until recently. So now I've been thinking about the importance of it.

I'll use two examples for what I'd define ""writing what you know"" executed less than ideally, and nicely. 

The first is a girl's short story that we worshopped recently. She is a 19-maybe-20 year old college student. Her story was about mid 1900's mafia stuff. The common point of critique for most people within the circle, including the professor, was that the representation of the mafia was not believable whatsoever. I believe that this was because she didn't know mafia, and she didn't research it enough. 

My example for writing what you know successfully is much more general. The great popularity and success of young adult novels on topics such as middle/high school, depression, bullying, romance, etcetera. And then you have veterans who write about their experiences with war. Or fantasy/Scifi/post apocalyptic authors taking and transforming their own home lands into mystical places that they still know like the back of their hands (Fallout). 

Most of these people are writing what they know, and that makes it so much more genuine. 

I feel that writing what we know gives us some sort of high ground over others in certain topics and genres. You may write something inspired from your own experiences or write a story set in your home town, and gain the ability to imagine the story and setting much easier."

136,EleLore,Discussion,16,writing,1606672870,"To all my fearful fellows who can't write right now for some goddamn reason. Hi me too, let's talk So I am a bilingual person. I speak Spanish and English, and when I lived in Mexico I knew writing was my passion. Writing in my native tongue, reading in my native tongue, speaking in my native tongue, I basically was growing a full mental greenhouse and nourishing the flowers and plants I allowed to grow which became my safe haven or my inspiration place. I move to the US and I have to move all that to the side so I can practice and learn more English, its vocabulary and sentence structure (which is obviously obnoxiously different and it caused me to put these plants away to make room for... Other things I suppose). I began to learn, I began to write, something I thought I knew how to do, but not anymore. So insecurity came in, I read mostly in English, and began to be thirsty for a connection with a book that I would read. 

6 years later, and for some reason I believe that being in academia is my calling. That I was supposed to be a professor all along. But here I am, with a pile of extremely interesting articles that don't call for me, and I sit frozen in front of my laptop not knowing how to put my thoughts coherently in an electronic piece of paper. I decide to write my thoughts in a poetic sort of way, but what I write (wether it's in English or Spanish) is very short, limited in descriptive narrative, and I caught myself recycling words to express my thoughts. And then I notice that I have not read anything that made my chest flutter with emotion or caused me to stop reading because this ONE sentence is so beautifully or magnificentlywritten. I notice how even if I read well written articles or books (in English) for that matter, I couldn't even focus.

I decided to go back to my roots. Go back to what started my mad desire to write and pin down this feeling in my chest that nothing seems to fulfill. I know that there is a correlation on reading and  writing. I'm going to read my favorite books in Spanish, the ones who inspired me to write. I'm finally going to nourish my safe haven. It will cost me the quarter in school, but I'm already in this deep dark pit, and I'm so ready to get out. Reading books with the desire of regaining motivation, inspiration, and my love for writing is one of my plans. I know it's the reason why I wanted to write. I'm posting this question for you. 

What motivated you from the beginning of your journey? What and/or who inspired you? How do you feel looking back at it, going back at it? 

I wholeheartedly believe that if we read what inspired us, we read of who inspired us, we can at least give a small step out of this funk."

The first part is called 'The Autumn' because of the time of year it takes place, and it is about a digital artist and a poltergeist and their day to day life, with hints that the end of the world is approaching.

The second part is called Billiard because the protagonist has an 8-ball for a head, and is about how this person who has had their identity erased/stolen through paradox-alternate selves meeting stuff, and becomes a multiverse-traveling bounty hunter to try and get their identity back but eventually gives up and accepts that they're never going to get it back.

The last part is a two sided story showing the perspectives of both the protagonist and antagonist, the protagonist is a brand new bounty hunter who's significant other is in a death loop prison ran by the bounty agency they're apart of, and because of this wants to make a more 'ethical prison' so that no one has to endure that pain, and eventually looses sight of that goal.The antagonist is a bounty hunter gone rogue that travels the multiverse, killing hundreds of criminals by the day, one day coming across the protagonist who tries killing them, and eventually abandoning their morals due to selfishness and self preservation.

The thing that all the protagonists all have in common is that they all become worse than what they were before, most of which due to losing sight of their original goals and values in some way.

The underlying message of it all is 'Anyone can become a bad person, even if they are doing good things, or have a heart of gold. It just takes a big enough push.'

With that, what should the series as a whole be called, and if you want, a title for the final part."

148,RaenWynnG,Advice,10,writing,1606668384,"Advice on writing trans characters I'm not sure if this post belongs here or on r/lgbt 

I have a character who was part of an all-female militia group. Pre-story, she starts questioning her identity and comes to accept that she is in fact a he. Not wanting to get driven out of the militia or persecuted, he runs away and goes into hiding. This is what starts off the B-plot. (His character arc is the journey he goes through, learning how to open up to others and trust that people will accept him for who he is)

Essentially what I'm trying to ask is: 

- is it okay that I'm including a character who identifies as trans when I myself, don't? 
- is the fact that his identity directly ties into major plot points acceptable?
- how much detail should I go into about the persecution he fears without seeming like I'm discriminating against the LGBTQIA+ community?
- there are other characters who identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community in the story, but their identities are not directly related to major plot points. There are subtle hints that I will include that will point towards that. Is it okay that I'm giving the spotlight to one character's identity because of plot reasons?
- as a member of the aro-ace community, I'm very much repulsed by romance. As such I'm trying to avoid romantic subplots in my story. By doing this, am I robbing my audience of gay/lesbian/bi/pan representation (even though they are characters that fall under those labels)?

152,reddithello456, ,2,writing,1606667270,"First few pages from a sci-fi book I'm writing, what do you think of it so far  I just got back up from being unconcious, with every part of my body hurting like never before, and huge blocks of scrap metal and concrete laying everywhere around me, one of them being very sharp and very near my head, I was lucky I survived.

Last thing I remember was sightseeing in an old WW2 era german bunker, then it happened, first the extemally loud sound of explosion, then the bright flash of light despite me being underground, then the collapsation of the bunker and me getting unconcious.

First I checked for any other surviving people near me, I find nothing but people dead from either getting hit by heavy objects or fried alive from the blast, some of their bodies already rotten, this means I was unconcious for longer than I thought.

Survivor's Journal, Day 1.

9:46 AM, No luck with finding any food or useful supplies, thankfully my watch is still working and I managed to craft a simple hatchet with a piece of concrete, a stick, and some random piece of rope lying on the ground.

10:58 AM, There are surprisingly lots of trees growing around, also I managed to notice that my skin appears to have changed it's color, and I'm a lot less thirsty than usual, the mutation might explain how I survived so long that trees managed to re-grow while I was unconcious.

12:34 AM, I'm hungry as I've never been in my entire life, still didn't find any food so far. Only a newspaper saying something about North Korea and nuclear war, I didn't bother reading it because the hunger was so overwhelming.

2:48 PM, I think I might actually die from starvation, so if you find this notebook, It most likely means I'm already dead, please find my body and make me some kind of grave, I don't want my body to rot in the open field.

7:19 PM Yes! I finally found some food! I harvested all the oranges from a bush hidden in tall grass, and ate half of them. I'll be saving the remaining 3 for later, despite still being hungry.

8:30 PM It's really getting dark and cold, I should probably make some sort of campfire.

9:28 PM I managed to make a campfire, I never thought that youtube video I saw 4 years ago would be the cause of me not dying from cold.

11:58 PM I made myself an improvised bed from some hay and leaves I found, but for some reason I don't feel the need to sleep, I begin to think that maybe not taking that newspaper with me was a bad idea, I could have finished reading it now to ""kill the boredom""

0:51 AM I heard strange noises nearby, he kind of that I never heard before, they sound really dangerous.

1:36 AM The noises continue. I polished the biggest, sturdiest rock I could find and attached it to a durable piece of wood using the remaining string I had, and prepared to defend myself.

3:28 AM A heavily mutated creature that looks like it once might have been a human jumps out of the trees, I take a defensive stance, however instead of attacking me, the creature sniffs my smell from a discance and proceeds to ignore me. I still watch what's it doing closely while thinking of possible escape routes, but it doesn't do anything dangerous for the next 2 hours.

5:32 AM I hear a distant cry for help. The creature hears it too, roard and starts running in the direction it came from. I try to stay as quiet as possible as I slowly realize it might be attracted to noise. After the creature is gone, I write down everything that happened since 2:48 PM and then begin planning my next day to ensure my survival.

Survivor's Journal, Day 2:

6:00 AM I begin to examine a huge rock, I'm a geologist, however, I don't recognise this kind of mineral, it doesn't resemble any known mineral or ore, it must have either come from space or gone through some chemical reaction caused by the heat and radiation from the explosion.

11:41 AM I ate the 3 remaining oranges I had and I gathered some of the strange ore using the tool I made last night, it appears to work very well as a pickaxe. I then smelted the ore using a campfire and some stone moulds. I covered parts of the campfire in the strange metal I case if I want to cook some food or smelt the metal more effectively.

3:42 PM I crafted an improvised backpack from the leather I got from a dead deer. It must have died recently since the meat isn't either rotten or cooked from the blast. I dried it's tendons and used it as strings, saving some for later and using the rest for the backpack.

4:56 PM I cooked the meat from the deer watching each part of it carefully so that none gets burned or undercooked, this is my only remaining food after all.

5:12 PM Finally, I'm actually not hungry anymore, I even managed to save some of the cooked meat for later. I should probably start making some sort of shelter.

9:52 PM I somehow managed to make a door. Out of stone. It took me quite some time to make it, but it works perfectly fine, and it's very durable. I'm really proud of what I just made.

10:28 PM I think I should have made my shelter out of wood instead of stone, it would have taken way less time, and I'm all out of time now. I'm hearing a lot of noises, and they sound hostile.

12:07 PM A man ran out of the bushes, dressed in a suit made out of boar leather and tendons, with a mark of a 9mm bullet splattered on the suit's left arm. He screamed at me in panic in a language I didn't understand, sounded like russian or ukrainian. I spoke calmly in my native language trying to tell him that I'm not a threat, and that I don't understand him, and does he speak English, and that we can work together to survive. He looked at me with a confused look on his face, took something out of his backback and threw it to the ground, and before I could see what it was, he punched me right in the face! I reached for my pickaxe to defend myself, but he didn't bother attacking me again, he took some of the stone bricks and made and began assembling it into walls, maybe he isn't an enemy.

2:28 AM The thing he threw on the ground was a second boar leather suit, visibly more damaged than his, it was covered in splinters of wood and contained loads of bullet markings, and some bite marks that look like they were made by... human teeth? It was still better than the remains of clothes I had on me, so I put the suit on, it was very warm, way warmer than my previous clothes. I then proceeded to spin three times, very fast. I have no idea why I did that, I think I was trying to express my joy and say thank you to the stranger without knowing how to communicate with him. Surprisingly, the stranger seemed to understand, smiled, then proceeded to spin one time. Then we both started to build, I made the bricks, he placed them and sticked them together using some sort of cement that smelled more like polymer glue than cement.

3:48 AM We focused so much on building that we completely forgot about the danger that was surrounding us. I heard loud sniffing noises from behind me, before I could turn around, I was bitten in the back of my head by the very same creature that spared me the other night. The suit protected me enough for the teeth to not rip my skin open, but the bite force was so huge that It felt like getting hit by two hammers simultanously. I tried to get my head out, but the monster kept it's jaws shut and tried to bite a part of my head out. The stranger pulled out his axe and attempted to cut off the monsters head off, but it has nearly no effect. The monster, now with lime green blood dripping out of it's wound, released it's jaws and kicked the stranger in the stomach, knocking him away. The stranger osed the force of the beast's kick to do a half-backflip and get up on his feet. The mutant charged at him, and the stranger dodged it's attack, then hit the ""ghoul"" in the back with his axe. I didn't make that name, it was the word that followed the long string of russian insults he screamed at the monstrocity that was attacking both of us. The creature charged at my ally and after he dodged it's attack, it changed it's direction and jumped right on him, almost crushing him under it's body that was twice as big as that of a normal-non mutated human. But the person helping me seemed to have underwent slight mutation, just like me. And it seems that it also enchanced his durability, because he didn't seem to get hurt from the crushing weight of the ghoul at all. The stanger, or should I rather call him now, teammate, managed to wrestle his way out of the ghouls's grip before I could help him, then he scared the ghoul away by flexing with some pro moves with his axe and shouting at the ghoul at the same time. The ghoul ran away. We both thought that it was the end of the trouble for today. We both put our weapons down and got back to finishing the shelter.

5:52 AM My teammate and I paused building the walls of our shelter despite being nearly finished with it, we both were way too tired by the fight that happened an hour ago and the constant building. He pointed at himself, saying ""я Dimitri, tvoye imya?"" While gesturing with his hands to help me understand what he was saying. Before I could answer, the roars around us got unusually loud, now coming from two sides. We grabbed our weapons, preparing ourselves for a fight. Two ghouls charged at us, from both sides, both ignoring me and focusing on Dimitri. Dimitri was fighting well, but he couldn't hold on much longer if he was fighting 1v2. Once I got a chance I threw my hatchet at the seemingly non-injured ghoul, splitting it's right eye open, and drawing it's attention to me. I grabbed my pickaxe and hit the ghoul in the left side on the head as hard as I could, the pickaxe sunk deep in it's head but the ghoul was still alive, or probably undead at this point because I noticed a couple of bulled wounds in it's neck and stomach, they all failed to kill it, and so failed my pickaxe. The ghoul used it's superior weight and strength to move his head rapidly towards me, ripping the pickaxe out of my hands and getting it's teeth dangerously close to the only part of my body not protected by the leather suit I was wearing, my face. Dimitri kicked the ghoul he was fighting away with a strong kick in the chin, then threw his axe, hitting the ghoul I was fighting in the neck, splitting it's spinal cord into two pieces and nearly cutting it's head off. However, that just stunned the ghoul for a short period of time, it was still got up from the ground after a few seconds, but that was enough for me to get my pickaxe back, but not enough to pick up Dimiri's axe. The sight of the ghoul getting up despite sustaining so much injury was enough to make Dimitri and me panic, we both ran away in separate directions.

5:58 AM I think I lost the ghoul that was chasing me. I climbed a tree and started to look around in an attempt to find Dimitri. I can't see him yet, but I hear loud, unusual ghoul sounds that I have never heard before. I proceed to run as quietly as possible in that direction.

5:59 AM The sounds are clearly the worst ones you could hear in the situation I was in, munching. I grab by pickaxe tighter, start running as fast as I can in the direction they're coming from and prepare myself for the worst while still having a tiny bit of hope that Dimirti's still alive.

Survivor's Journal, Day 3:

8:21 AM When I got there, the sun has already risen, and Dimitri was already dead, with his body and protective leather suit both damaged beyond repair. The ghoul who killed him appears to have his skin fried for some reason. Right after I finished building my stone wall shelter, I made a grave for Dimitri near the walls of the base, specifically the part he started building. The message on the gravestone I carved read:

Dimitri, the suvivor

Surname: Unknown

Age of death: Unknown

He died a valiant hero, sacrificing himself for the good of others and protecting them from the vile creatures known as ghouls.

May he rest in peace.

9:10 AM I ate the cooked meat I obtained yesterday, then harvested some juicy oranges and put them in a cold dirt pit so that they won't spoil.

9:40 AM I wanted to cry because of both nearly loosing my life yesterday, Dimitri's death, and the overall shock and pain that I still didn't get over with, but my survival instinct told me to now waste any water on the tears and move on If I want to survive. I obeyed that instinct like a loyal soldier. I'm suspecting the mutation might have also given me enchanced memory since I just finished writing down the events that happened in the last 2 days while being 100% sure of every single event, flawlessly remembering everything I saw and did, even the time it happened on. I suspect it might have also removed or lowered my need for drinking water, since I don't feel the urge to drink any liquids anymore, just like I don't feel the need to sleep. I use this opportunity to salute and drop some tears at Dimitri's grave, then begin carefully planning my next actions."

I am concerned that if this keeps up I’ll never get to write anything. So what should I do? Cause I want them written, so right now I have been trying to write on one till I get stuck and move on to another, but it always comes to bite me in the butt as I am no longer happy with what’s written.

I came late to [this video by Brandon Sanderson](https://youtu.be/mMeNnX1FGgg) on writing your first novel, but one thing he mentioned that I found interesting was his recommendation to take a very formulaic story structure and put your own spin on it. The examples he gave were Heist stories and Mysteries.  
I'm wondering if there are any other genres that follow as tight a formula as these ones?"
163,ohnonara,Advice,11,writing,1606662870,"I need help Hi everyone, I’m a regular kid from a third-world country and I study in one of the best universities in Asia. This is an international university and all of our classes are in English. Even though I had top grades and got admitted easily, I never studied English properly. During the high school, I watched a lot of Netflix and YouTube, had many international friends and was part of the amazing communities. As a result, my English level improved to B2-C1.

But the thing is, I can’t read or write in proper English. My maximum is a Reddit post like this or a chat with a friend. I struggle a lot reading long texts like books, fanfiction, etc.

To get accepted to this university, you have to have really good IELTS/SAT/Duolingo results. Or pass an English proficiency exam provided by this institution. So I passed it with the highest score possible. I was so happy that I didn’t even imagine that I’ll struggle like this.

We have a mandatory writing course here and I thought that it will help me to learn needed skills for academic writing so I’ll be able to write essays and short articles. Oh boy, I was so wrong. We started from summaries and our first homework is to write a summary about this damned article. And I don’t know what to do.


It’s so messed up. I’m not able to submit homework in time or do required readings because I don’t understand many words and lack skills to do that. I need advice: How can I improve my English and be able to read/write academic texts? I’m ready for everything, even if it’ll take much time and work. Just need a start point and advice"

176,janeconquest,Advice,10,writing,1606653761,"How to cope with the worry that my writing is not objectively good? I have written 8 books and self-published 3 of them on Amazon to a small amount of success (around 100 copies sold per book). This was not entirely the reason I was always down on my abilities—I had an epiphany this year that I was not satisfied with any my books because I was writing them for an audience, as opposed to for myself. 

So, I began a project where I can finally say I am proud of this book, even if it sells as few copies as the others. At last, I realized I could only find satisfaction within myself. My worry now lies in the idea that my writing is not objectively good—this book is powerful to me, but I am unsure if it is accessible to a broad audience. I write to try to help and inspire others like good books do for me, but what is “objectively” good? Who decides the merit of a creative work other than a general widespread acclaim/critical success—which may be seen after the writer’s lifetime? It’s a depressing thought, and in this age of social media where a number of followers is displayed next to your name, it’s hard to enjoy this new satisfaction when I am still focusing on reaching a large audience. 

All I can do is write work I am proud of, which makes me successful in my book (no pun intended [okay, maybe a little intended]), but does anyone have advice on how to quell these plaguing thoughts and focus less on traditional ideas of success? 

TL/DR: I’m 19 and feel like a failure, even after finally writing a book I am proud of. Words of advice would be appreciated."

How do you keep the pacing flowing nicely when you are essentially hitting the reset button at the end of the first two chapters?

180,IGuessIAmSpider-Man,Discussion,24,writing,1606649103,"After one very long year I finally finished my first book! Writing it was a lot harder than I expected. So hard in fact that I actually quit writing it for months, but I couldn't stop thinking about the story which resulted in me returning to the book. When I finished I actually could not believe it. I felt like I still had more to write, but I was actually finished. Now I'm off to what I think will be my favorite part, editing. I'm glad that I didn't rush the process. If I did then I wouldn't have come up with so many good ideas for the following books. I wouldn't know what direction I wanted my series to take. I have heard so many times that my writing sucks and it is lacking and at times I completely believed those people. I know I'm not the greatest writer, but I've learned that quitting doesn't make you a better one. Finishing this book was probably one of the most important things that has happened in my life. It gives me motivation to keep on writing, keep striving, keep trying, and keep getting better!

I don't know where to go after this though. My dream is to have my book in a bookstore. But I have no idea on how to get an agent or who to talk to about publishing. I know I have a long road ahead of me before I reach that point, but I want to make the journey there as smooth as possible. So, what do I do next?"

190,FerretingAboot, ,22,writing,1606641099,"Getting Published Vs Identity Politics Okay so ignore the headline sounding like a boxing match. Here's something that's been gnawing at both me and my best friend, both aspiring authors.

For fun we recently had an evening where we binge watched/read some first-time authors awards contests in our respective genres. We kinda hoped doing so would help give that kick up the backside of ""you can do it too"" and there's the general satisfaction of seeing people receive awards for their hard work. 

Thing is, it didn't quite have the motivating effect we'd hoped for. Not exclusively but considerably more often than not a trend quickly emerged. Almost all the writers receiving awards were either LGBT, PoC or both and the key point to their books were just that too. 

Now hold on hold on, put that pitchfork down. Obviously having an open and accepting community where anyone can achieve success on the merit of their own hard work is a great thing. This isn't me moaning that non-white people are getting published. My point is that a vast majority of these writers and their books were completely honed in on these aspects. 

When it came to the summaries of the stories so many began with 
""X a young gay man...""
""As a transgender woman...""
""Life on a spaceship is hard when you haven't come out yet"" 
""X wasn't just the newest knight in the order, he was the only black knight"" 

I didn't even know what the ""best in category"" book was about for one of the ceremonies we watched, just that the author and protagonist were lesbians.

And then to read about said award ceremonies so many seemed to just be patting themselves on the back at how many LGBT and PoC authors they'd selected, one even saying ""it was refreshing not seeing a single white face on the awards panel"" 

That's where the sinking feeling sets in a little for me and my friend, that maybe when it's our turn to present our work to publishers or to a similar contest we'll be completely overlooked based not on the content of our stories but because we, or our characters, aren't in keeping with the agenda they're after. 

Now granted this could just be a fleeting concern, or it could be as simple as we happened upon a string of contests and judges that aren't representative of the rest of the industry as a whole. But it's a little disheartening to think that who you are as a person or who you write for could determine if your writing ever sees the light of day or not, instead of the quality of said writing itself. 

I'm very curious to hear from other writers on this topic, have you ever seen similar situations, do you feel it's a bit biased or are you in favour of it? Do you write your stories or characters any differently to accommodate things like this? I look forward to reading your responses!

And a final disclaimer cos I know there's gonna be some out there, let me make this as clear as possible 

I'm not complaining that PoC and LGBT authors are getting published, I'm not complaining that stories focused around PoC or LGBT characters/issues are  being published. My only trepidation is that it seems in some cases the race or sexual identity of the writer or the subject matter seems to be playing a very large part in deciding who gets chosen at these events, not the actual work itself. 

Also for those curious the genres we were looking at were Fantasy and Sci-Fi predominantly, I could completely understand such issues dominating genres like romance, modern drama, historical period pieces ect as it quite frankly makes for a great narrative obstacle that's ever present in the protagonists life."
191,Keiracat07,Advice,2,writing,1606641047,"Is this bad to do? TL:DR is it bad to include a character from another franchise in my book if he's from a personal AU that changes everything about him completely in terms of personality, design, voice, and actions (more important info down below)

In my book a big part of the story is revolved around this character called Miles, he's a two tailed fox who's not from the planet my book takes place on. There's been a war and it's completely messed him up, the fur on his tails are practically gone and he's got a robot eye and part of his tail has been built into a rocket launcher. He's also lost an eye

All of his friends from his world are dead so he goes to the nearest planet that he can reach (Planet-0666 at the time since it doesn't have a name) his personality is basically a tsundere who opens himself up after he learns he can trust the sinners (demons) from hell, this is also how the Avians (Angels) are introduced since he ends up going to them and gets killed when it's found out he was friends with the sinners

The thing is if people actually try to find out more they'll see this guy is actually from a personal AU of a popular video game called Sonic The Hedgehog, it's an really edited one with basically everyone being dead and Miles personality being permanently changed due to trauma from the war, only ones left at this later time are Miles and Shadow (who doesn't appear since he's basically the same but more of an edgelord, I made this au in 2017)

I am excited beyond imagination, but in the recent months there's been an extreme encompassing sense of dread. 

This is the most vulnerable I've ever been in my life. I've always been a closed book, even to some of my closest friends. The story contains allegory to my life that won't be obvious to readers, but will be extremely apparent for friends and family (if the book sells at all)... I've been building this world in my head since I was 11 years old, and especially into my years working in construction/oilfields. Events and scenery very closely resemble traumatic events, and things I've experienced, places I've been.. It's honestly pretty damn terrifying thinking that people I know might view me differently if they happen to read it, especially if they understand the symbolism... Plus I decided to use my real name as my pen name..

 I've been building this world for so long that harsh widespread criticism will likely put me in a serious depression. The Illustrator is super confident its gonna be a hit, but he's obviously pretty biased as he's been working on it with me for like 2 years lmao.. 

  I just don't want to make the next ""The Room"" if you know what I mean. To be where I am and completely bomb to me is worse than never getting published in the first place.   I have no idea if there even a demographic for this thing. It's been a uphill battle attempting to keep it un-meddled by the publisher too. So many headaches (In short, the main character is Black, and because of the whole Black Lives Matter Movement this summer, they had a big desire to incorporate that into the marketing... And we fought VERY hard for that to end.. because using a activist movement to sell a book is gross.. and just kind of tokenizes the entire story..) That was not fun. 

Any advice from other writers would be very welcome. I didn't think I'd be having a mental breakdown AFTER my ""dreams came true"""

Surprisingly they liked it. I played around with in class jokes and stuff. Like we got two guys sharing the same name so i thought to make them twin assassins. One girl was so good at dissing people without saying a single swear word so I named her Viper of the Court. I also played with class relationships so like while one guy is the lord of dragons, another guy was know as the dragon slayer.

This is my very first post here (so I hope a post like this is even allowed on here). At first glance, it probably looks unnecessarily long, and that is because it is, I won't lie to you. If you read the title (and the TL;DR right below) then you have read enough, but if by any chance you want to know more about my situation and thoughts, by all means read the rest.

**TL;DR:** Recently gained an interest in writing; primarily that of non-fiction stories/experiences about myself/have ha and/or just my thoughts and ideas. I am NOT a very creative person; poetry, for example, is not my strong suit nor something I want to pursue. Writing miscellaneous things here on Reddit has been cutting it so far, so what are some good subreddits I could write the aforementioned things on? Are there any other good platforms besides Reddit I could use as well? Finally, what are some solid tips/advice could you give to a beginner that you wish you knew when you first started writing?

────────────────────

I'm really just looking for some generic tips from anyone in the same boat as me when it comes to writing. And when I say “tips”, I don't necessarily mean on how to format things or in terms or grammar; I just mean more broad, general pointers/advice on basically anything I need to know, if not how to maintain this recent interest in writing that I've acquired. I've been writing for a while, ever since 1st or 2nd grade (like anybody else I think), and like to believe that I was always fairly decent at it (though I'm also just as positive that there is plenty of room for improvement). But I never actually got truly into writing until just recently, for lately I have found it to be very therapeutic (as well as just a good way to kill time). I mean hell, I'm asking a simple question here, yet just look at how unnecessarily long this post is... I just seem to enjoy it a lot for some reason. Anyways, reading any more of this post isn't mandatory for answering my question, but to elaborate further...

Lately, I have just been using Reddit to jot down my thoughts and stories/experiences, ask my questions, among many other things, for it is Reddit, after all; there are communities for literally any thing or topic you can think of, really. I guess the only problem with that is, Reddit is the only platform on which I can write anything that I actually know how to use. I am aware of things like Blogger and Tumblr, but I don't exactly know how “blogging” works or what I would post, but from what I do know, it doesn't seem like something very fitting for me. Wattpad seemed promising at first, but apparently that's centered more around fictional stories by aspiring writers/authors, and I fit absolutely nowhere in that realm. There are of course a plethora of other online forums I could sign up for, but as I mentioned above, Reddit (as of right now) is really the only one I need, and I'm not going to sign up for a website I am not going to use (or see myself using very) actively. With that being said, do you guys have any suggestions on what other writing platforms I could use to write (or at least get a better hang of it) and publish with (if not, just some subreddits)?"

A good story is best carried by the characters, whether entertaining, quirky, and easily identified and distinguished ones in comedy/fluff or sympathetic and emotionally relatable on some level in drama. 

If you must build a book off an idea, don't have a spark be ""A Western... but with vampires!"". Try something like ""How would a portal fantasy affect someone in later life? Would they eventually convince themselves it wasn't real? Would they snap?"".

I thought of these scenarios off the top of my head, but one clearly has more potential to be great, even if the other presents a better outline. 

Almost everything is key in some way or another in writing, but apart from prose there's nothing that makes or breaks something more than whether you want to follow a character's journey. There's a reason the eight deadly words are ""I don't care what happens to these people,"" not ""this plot is just the hero's journey *again*"" or ""this world is flimsy and unrealistic other words"". 

That's not to say that plot or setting aren't important, but the point is that they're not as good for ""sparks/conciets/hooks/"" .

About 7-8 weeks ago I started a blog, with the intention of building a fictional universe centered around two recurring protagonists. I’ve been keeping up with the weekly posts since then, releasing each story in fragments; the first story finished up last week, and the second one started today. I’ve got content queued up for the next six weeks in advance, and I’ve started work on a third story.

Thing is, what I’m writing doesn’t seem to turn out good, even with backtracking and editing. I certainly get a kick out of writing it, but it’s falling very, very far from the goals I want to reach. In a word: it’s fun, but it’s still schlock. Plus, it feels like I can’t stop writing schlock. 

I don’t want to create higher literature (just ask my creative writing teachers - I sucked at it), but I was hoping to create some kind of emotional resonance in the reader - the sort of thing that’d make them audibly gasp or do a fist-pump while reading, and right now it feels like it’s all falling flat.

I’m not too concerned about receiving flak from anybody for creating crap right now, given that the blog’s viewership bounces between 0 and 1 on any given day. But ideally I want to be able to create something better than this, something meaningful that I can be genuinely proud of.

After about 10 pages I got another idea, and another setting, and this thing that I’m stuck with now gets to me every time - I open my laptop, I go to the same folder, and I see several drafts that I started long time ago and I just can’t pick one to work on. For sure, I can pick something that will address some current issues in a real world, I can pick something that is representing new concepts in already established genres, but my question is this - maybe I’m not really meant for writing in a first place having this mindset, or this kind of approach can be settled in any possible way? 
I’m not going to lie, this weird kind of writers block is something completely new for me. Maybe there is some kind of effective way to prioritize what needs to be done I’m to blind to see?"
240,dlbrt44,Discussion,1,writing,1603497845,"Formatting flashbacks How would you guys do it?

If this makes sense, it's not whole scenes that I'm taking the narrative back to, but rather images from the past. I thought about writing them in disjointed stream of consciousness writing but will probably end up writing them in long and flowing and almost poetic sentences. My book takes place over the course of two days the core of the 'action' hinges on misunderstandings of things people mention (the flashbacks are there to make it clear where the sentiment comes from in the mind of the person who said it). 

How would you structure these? I am thinking about possibly borrowing from Faulkner and opening and closing these with a sentence in italics, but I'm not sure. If I establish sentences and paragraphs in parentheses or brackets as flashbacks, would people catch on?"
241,munnbun,Advice,2,writing,1603497839,"Changing from illustrating to writing: Lost in the proverbial sauce So, at heart, I'm an artist. I'm used to conveying an idea with an image. Interpretations aside, it's rather straightforward. You see all that I drew. But in writing there is motion, there is change in the setting, feelings of characters, thoughts, etc. This, to me, makes it quite powerful. 

People have told me I write decently but I speed through events way too quickly. I have no way of telling if I am rushing through an important scene or going too slowly through insignificant details.

 So, I ask, how do you know when you have it right?

How does one go at a proper pace, feeding the reader necessary information, and not be filling the scene/chapter/book with drawn out explanations?"
242,RedditBoy2266,Discussion,1,writing,1603497621,"What do you think of the way I have a balance with superpowers and magic in my world? First, I must show examples of both.

Superpowers: Mutants, Metahumans, Quirks, and Inhumans

Magic: Witch, Wizard, Sorcerer, and Mage


The way I handle both is my world.

So I wanted to have a balance with both in my world. I wanted one to do something the other couldn't do. For the most part, magic users and superhumans in my world are like their different fictional universes counterparts. Meaning magic-users still cast spells to used their magic and still learn different spells and study magic. And superhumans still get their powers through genetic mutations and experiments or accidents.

So now the balance. Magic users are versatile because of their spells. Depending on the magic-user knowledge of magic. The magic-user can have a shit load of powers aka spells. While a superhuman only has one power. So they are limited to their one quirk. So this is where balance comes in. If a magic-user has spells. And each spell allows the magic-user to control each of the 4 elements of water, fire, air, and the earth. Then a magic-user only has a nerfed version of those powers. Meaning a magic-user fire spell is not as strong as a superhuman who has the mutant ability to control fire. Because superhumans have a more OP version of the powers. A superhuman may be limited to one power. But whether it be the mutant ability to control water or fire. That superhuman one power is still stronger than the same power the magic-user has.

The balance is 
Magic-users have a versatility advantage over superhumans. Superhumans are limited to one power. While the magic-users have a spellbook full of powers.

And the superhuman has a more powerful advantage over magic users. Yea a witch has a spell for fire. But a superhuman with the ability to control fire has a more powerful OP version of fire. A witch can only burn down a house with fire. While a superhuman can burn down the whole world with fire. Magic-users need a lot of practice to do spells depending on the person. And the magic users also need to say words backward for their spells to work. While superhuman just need to think and the powers are shown. Because superhumans powers are like any other body movement. The brain sent a message to move the hand. The brain also sent a message to shoot fire.

So in conclusion. Magic users are versatile but have nerfed versions of powers. Superhumans are powerful. But are only limited to one power or maybe some secondary powers or a couple of powers if you are superman. But either way, superhumans are still limited for the most part."

244,SCEvansmeister, ,2,writing,1603496559,"Story from a non-human's POV Some context, first: I posted here some months ago about how to proceed with a planned series after mistakenly publishing Book 1 through a vanity publisher, and whether I should redo everything as part of a 5-story anthology, discarding a universe I had spent a decade refining as a result. I ultimately decided to go the anthology route, mixing those characters with other separate planned projects, while leaving my original planned saga on the backburner to revisit one day.

The first story in this anthology, without giving too much away, centers on a giant monster that surfaces after millions of years and wanders through Australia, trying to make sense of a drastically different planet. The story is third-person, mainly focusing on the monster and the thoughts he has as he encounters humans and communicates with other monsters, all the while leaving the actions of humans out as much as possible. However, while I believe that I could make this a unique experience, I feel this could present issues with the story - for example, humanity would inevitably craft something to take the monster down, and decides to attack him in his sleep; from the monster's POV, having just woken up, he'd be ignorant to the weapon's creation and it would seem to him that this thing just came out of nowhere. Also, writing monsters 'talking' to each other could border on cheesy (to humans, it would look like the Indominus Rex communicating with the Raptors in Jurassic World).

What are some tips on making giant monsters as compelling as human characters without making it look overtly out of place?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you're all doing well."

I'm an only child, and the closest I know about siblings is that many of my friends have siblings and one of my best friends calls me his sister. I want to write a story about a pair of twin sisters. I'm aiming to make them approximately 18-25 years old, so roughly college-aged. Here's what I know about sibling relationships:

1) calling each other everything but their actual names and never calling each other ""sister/brother"". One of my friends, the sweetest guy you'll ever know btw, called up his brother when he went grocery shopping and started with ""yo fuckface, how poor are you?"" Another called his little brother ""dickhead""

2) Excessive need to make sure your sibling(s) never have an extra drop/crumb of anything, sometimes this is excessive measuring of things

3) ""Only I'm allowed to pick on my sibling"" kind of dynamic, in which siblings can be really cruel to each other, but will beat up anyone else who tries to do the same

I wish I listened to dad’s advice for not breaking in when he was explaining how the old lady died. He said that she died in a tragic accident in her OWN house! She was fixing her clock when it fell on her and made her trip down the stairs. 

Tick!

What is that noise? I looked up to the walls. Just stuffed animal heads…wait...are they all stuffed animal heads? I looked behind me…I was white with fear…Ben was gone!

Tick!

There it is again! Thanks a lot old lady for falling down the stairs! The corridors though they were eye catching. They had sleek, velvet curtains hanging on the golden, bright windows. Carpets soft like bunnies. Everything was still in good shape! But how? The old lady died 10 years ago. I glanced at the stairs to see how they looked.

Tick!

That’s where the nose was coming! The grand-farther clock! Its handle danced side to side but...the clock was old and broken it wasn’t fixed like the rest of the house. Out of no -where a puff of smoke crowded the room. When it all disappeared…the lady…the old lady…the dead one…she had twitching eyes. Eyelids that never blinked. She had wrinkled skin like a raisin. A pink, flowered dress ripped at the end. She was floating next to the rigid clock. The lights began to flicker. It was like she vanished in an instant.

Could all the stories be true…that the spirit of the old lady haunts this house and vowed to take revenge on the people who un-loosened her clock…which was…me and Ben! It was supposed to be a harmless prank. Floods of tears raced down my face. What will happen to me?! Could this be the end?! Where was Ben?! What happened to him?!

I was watching the last two seasons of Game of Thrones recently and few of the characters have been making some db mistakes. Like Daenerys Targaryen rushing with her dragons all the way from Draginstone to 10000 miles faraway to the north of the wall to save a bunch of people, including Jon Snow. Now in retrospect, this decision seems stupid on her part because she is risking her life as well as her dragons for the sake of couple of men when her sole life purpose was to win the Iron Throne. She makes a couple of bad decisions in the last season as well. 
It got me thinking if the character herself was prone to being impulsive out of her love for Jon Snow and then acting irrationally. Or was it truly bad writing that made her actions inconsistent with what her personality was shown to be in the first few seasons of the show. 
Daenerys is not the only character who suffers this terrible arc. Tyrion. Jon Snow."

Does using real names disrupt readers’ suspension of disbelief in a fantasy story?

Should I instead make up names rather than using real ones?

How can I explain the racial diversity in the kingdoms? Like, if all these people were in one kingdom, wouldn’t they all just end up mixing together? I was thinking about making towns of different types of people, but I wasn’t sure how to pull that off.

Any other tips?

(I’ve been trying to avoid tokenism by adding more characters of the same race in the story.)

Thanks in advance."

I love writing and have been doing it since I could hold a pencil, but I just don't seem to have that spark of inspiration most writers have that help them dream up stories and plot ideas. Normally I wouldn't mind this, as writing is a personal hobby I like to keep stress-free, but it's gotten to the point where I've outlined a vibrant setting and interesting characters yet can't seem to come up with a plot to match. I sit down to write every day yet find myself giving up after 10 minutes or so because I... just don't know where I'm going. I suppose the actual plot isn't as important to me as other aspects of the story, but I'd like to actually have an outline laid out in my head as it makes writing substantially easier for me. 

If anybody has had or is having the same problem, how do you guys mainly find inspiration? Do you take ideas from your daily lives, watch similar movies, talk it out with someone, etc.? Are there any tools you find helpful? Any help whatsoever would be appreciated! Thank you!"

2. I’ve outlined it down to every last story beat.  It feels flat and it’s missing a sense of inspiration. Even thinking about it in this format is a chore. I’ve even written out descriptions of the environmental/political structure of the world, with deliberate attention given to the heart of the story and why I think the story matters.  Still feels “flat”. Upsetting.

3. I’ve written vignettes of short scenes where the thing that excites me about the characters/world are at the forefront.  The edges fade out and O can’t see how everything is connected.

4. I’ve drawn picture of the characters that excite me in various forms.  The pictures, while satisfying, don’t tell me enough vital information about the story to make it “go”.

I would say I am a decent writer when it comes to things like, vocabulary, creatively structuring sentences, and original ideas for stories. However, I am kind of lacking in my basic knowledge of story structure. 

One thing I was wondering was how exactly to write a climax when there is little action within a story. It's easy to envision a climax if you picture an action-packed story with lots going on, but it gets a bit harder when the story revolves mainly around a character's stream of consciousness or something. For example, if a story was written similarly to Catcher in the Rye (mine isn't, but this is a good example), how might one develop any kind of interesting climax? I'm realizing, as I am writing this, that this question is kind of stupid. But still, does anyone have any examples of things that might make up a climax without revolving around action or some profound realization or something like that?

Edit: there was a typo that pretty much completely changed what I was trying to ask lol. To be clear, I'm basically asking for examples of climaxes that don't involve some big drama, realization, action, etc.

316,candlelightandcocoa,Advice,11,writing,1612987079,"Would this be considered a prologue, or should I just call it Chapter 1? (fantasy novel) The first chapter in my first book of a fantasy series begins with a witch and a wizard  (female and male mage, I use the term 'Mage'). They have a conversation about the backstory and the main situation of the book--that the woman cast a spell on a non-magical man. She erased his life memories. The scene sets up the magic elements and spells, and it creates a feel for the ""fantasy"" part of the story.

The second chapter starts with the POV of the non-magical man. In contrast, it's very ordinary and about his struggles (finding a job, being poor, etc.) He has no idea what happened to him and who he used to be. Totally unaware of the magic spell. He knows he has a gap in his life memory, and it frustrates him. His old life's memories appear in vivid dreams.

Most of the main arc of the book from then on follows this man, (the MC) and a girl who ends up as his love interest. There are a few scenes and chapters in between this main arc about the Mage characters, (man and woman first introduced) and a pair of Mage spies. So I'm blending 'magic' scenes with 'mundane' scenes throughout the story.

Would the intro chapter be considered a prologue because it sets up the backstory, the magic spell, and the situation? Or is it best to just call it 'Chapter 1?'"

I'm a ttrpg designer and I took part in some jams last year and I hope to be able to publish/make/put out my first game this year.

# Introduction

While working on my main project, in the last few days I was tinkering around with domino pieces and I came up easily with many cool mechanics that could be paired well with those pieces (even cooler than the project I'm working on right now), so I think it would be stupid to just let it slide. They are good looking and very cheap objects, give a neat tactile sensation, the statistics associated with the draw is unique and bag mechanics are well known in the board games space despite being pretty novel in the rpg side of things.

Notice that I don't want to use those to build domino tracks, but those are meant to be drawn from a bag and then put them down on a grid to handle action resolution. This will be used to tiling out numerical grids.

# Themes and Inspiration

Now, my problem is that I don't know what a game with domino pieces as the main randomizers should be ***about***. While I'm pretty creative on the rule side of things and pragmatic, I tend to be less inspired about themes and sources of inspiration.

What I would like to know from you is...

* When you think at Domino Pieces, what does your mind immediately runs to?
* What historical period do you associate Domino pieces with?
* Are there sources of inspiration (such as movies, books, tv shows...) with Domino pieces as a relevant element? What kind of themes do they have?

Thank you very much!"

I'm making myself sick over it, and have had a constant stomach ache since I finished the most recent bit. But I'm let down by my male lead because he comes across too much like a side character and no I can't switch their roles (my beta reader assures me that I'm conveying strong differences between them but I don't see it), I feel like everything I write is filler no matter how much it actually advances the story...

I'm writing a war story and I know nothing about military strategy or even what sorts of tech levels every side should be at or what impact that would have on anything! It's fantasy but also modern but without modern military tech and I don't know anything about the necessary mindsets even though my villain deals in brainwashing and enthrallment spells so you'd think I could just skip that step and chalk it up to her magic but instead I feel like I have to elaborate on EVERYTHING.

People tell me that I have great worldbuilding in an ongoing fanfic I'm doing but that's playing around in someone else's sandbox, no matter how I widen it or how much more sand I add to it. Coming up with everything myself feels like something I should have done by now in the past 32 years but no, it's garbage and I feel like garbage. I really want to get this story out but I don't know how to properly accomplish that even though I'm the only person who can do it.

I feel like I'm letting everyone down. The characters, everything that served as inspiration, my friends, and future potential fans. It's a goddamn failure and I feel like a failure. I've been writing obsessively for a few months and it isn't GOING anywhere.

How do I break out of this? All I can think of is ""go write that fanfic for a while instead"" but I don't even have any ideas for that, and I'd still feel sick for not working on this."

Yep, I've gone all-in.

I've usually labelled it as Historical Fiction or Crime but it feels as though I might be misleading people expecting a certain format. I realise I've made my own bed here and am now having to lie in it, but maybe if nothing else this could serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who embarks on an epic multi-genre tale, in that it doesn't lend itself to 'tick one box only' requirements, which then makes marketing awkward and puts off agents who can't see how to sell it.

Would I write these out as a narrator type character saying the stuff like descriptors? Or would that be better suited some audio played. (Example a car driving by in a scene being depicted with the audio of a car)

366,RosedAnubis,Discussion,19,writing,1612945056,"Is outlining and editing your story more important than the actual writing process? Good morning writers,


Does anyone goes through this process? Am I the weird one? Am I procrastinating? I feel like I’m being productive, however can someone seasoned speak on this? Like every project demands it’s own unique process and methods sometimes.

I recently finished one story and I’m currently working on another. I find myself embarking a totally different process than the first story where I’ve written a outline, and I’m aggressively revising it before I even write the first draft. 

I had the idea to write the story last year which I did in a week only to chuck it out entirely because I felt it wasn’t interesting enough. I revisited and revised the story concept this January, developed an act 1, 2, 3 and character outline. 

I left it alone for a couple weeks to work on my small business, then, last week I told myself I was ready to draft the story, only to throughly outline every single scene of the story based on the original outline. Which I feel proud of. And now, I find myself editing the story and moments before even writing another draft. 

Does anyone goes through this process? Am I the weird one? Am I procrastinating? I feel like I’m being productive, however can someone seasoned speak on this?"

I have always been anxious about people stealing my work but realised it’s irrational, so I’m finally ready to post this. This is the beginning of a chapter (but not the full chapter). Side note: In my doc for this story there are a lot of paragraphs and new lines so the writing doesn’t get crowded. For some reason when I posted this my sentences got squeezed together. So if you notice I don’t start new lines enough it’s because the post was squeezed down and some dialogue starts in the wrong places.

The plane had landed in Idaho just a few hours ago. 
   Miss Campbell, as Morris, her personal driver called her, watched the pines pass her father’s Stutz Blackhawk as it sped along the unpaved road. They’d pulled off the highway an hour or so ago, and Bridie wondered why the road still hadn’t led them to the town yet.
   The trees around the car seemed to stretch for miles that she could see. The margin of the woods cramped the vehicle onto a steady course along the dirt, the road unwavering.
   Morris adjusted the rear view mirror from the driver's seat, his eyes, grey and wrinkled with age, gave her a sincere look. He would protect her at all costs. That was his job—other than being the Campbell family's personal chauffeur, of course.
   Her father had arrived at the mystery house on Wednesday afternoon, two days before the Summer break began. He hadn’t told Bridie about the place on purpose. She had left her home, the place she grew up, all for some crummy town up North. He probably didn’t want to disappoint her. Idaho was a big change from California—the trees. It was the trees. There were so many of them here—and people's clothing! It was as if their style had been held back five odd years, states in the middle of the United States were late to the new fashion due to their outdated television flicks and advertisements, she could tell because she and Morris had passed through a town a few miles back, and the clothing people wore were outdated too, women wearing long, feminine dresses. The girl scoffed. She glanced down at the white blouse she was wearing. There was a peach coloured dress tightened with a black belt beneath that. The colours complemented her dark skin.
   “Morris? We’re nearly there, are we not?”
   After a moment, the man glanced into the rear view mirror. “A few miles left, Miss Campbell,” He adjusted the mirror back to the road behind again, even though no cars drove nearby. 
People are just lining up to get to this town, I bet, Bridie crossed her arms against her chest and lent back against the leather.
   The sun beamed from the middle of the sky, a clear day. If it were later on she’d see the dark silhouettes of the forests passing over the sun. The girl looked at her small, gold-rimmed wristwatch, it’s hands pointed, the Roman numerals on it read: 3:37pm. The sun would be setting in a few hours, enough time for her to unpack and possibly meet someone new, explore a bit. She closed her eyes. Her father would like that a lot…

*    *    *

   “Miss Campbell, we’re here,” Morris’s voice was a blur beneath the whirring of the Blackhawk’s engine. 
   “Huh?” Bridie rubbed her eyes and stole a glance around. Morris switched off the engine from the driver's seat. “We’re here, at your new house, Miss Campbell”, he repeated.
   “Oh.”
   “I’ll get your bags inside, Miss Campbell.” He popped the trunk and filled his two hands with only a small portion's worth of her and her mother’s luggage. Bridie sat up. I must have dozed off on the way, she thought with a buzzing head.
   Morris, with his spare pinky finger, cranked open the door to let Bridie step out, and she nodded appreciation in his direction. 
   She looked up at the house—beautiful! Her expression proved genuinely surprised. It stood two stories tall and was walled with bricks, the windows around the house were perfectly cut into looming arches.
   She noticed Morris struggling to carry the two suitcases in his hands up at the front porch stairs. One suitcase rolled held on for dear life on an angle behind him. He was getting old, she knew, she’d known him for as long as she could remember. On the days that her fathers’ hadn’t enough time to play in her nursery, he’d been there. 
   “Here, let me help,” she offered from behind the man.
   “No, no, Miss Campbell, go inside, I’ll be fine,” he said, though he struggled with the bags still, trying, and failing to make an independent front of himself.
   “You know, you’re going to kill yourself one day looking out for me.” She grabbed one of the bags from his hands, “And,” Bridie said, “you don’t need to call me Miss Campbell.” 
   The man settled, glanced backward towards the girl as the weight was lifted off.
   “And you don’t need to call me Morris, Miss Campbell”, he smirked from over his shoulder, “a simple Mr. Allerman would do.”
   “Fair enough—but still, I’d like you to call me Bridie”, she smiled in sweet defeat.
   Morris didn't seem to hear it—or perhaps her remark didn’t need an answer—as he dug his hand into a pot that hung from the roof by the door, just above a small fence on the front porch.
   “Now. Your father said it would be just here.” He moved his hand around a little more. The pot swung slightly on its loosely tightened hinges. “Aha!” He pulled his hand away from the decor, and pinched by his long, frail fingers, a silver key. Morris turned the lock on the front door, before it opened ahead of them. He turned to Bridie and gave her a nod, a smile and a wink, which she couldn’t figure out, was it a Thankyou for helping with the bags, or, a sliver of charming arrogance? Morris turned the handle.
   The first thing Bridie beheld when the door opened was the chandelier. It hung just in the centre of the foyer, the sun shone through the windows from the room to its left, and the warm light passed through the chandeliers glassy jewels; gold rays of it were cast against the yellow and white striped wallpaper in its effect. It was as if she were underwater, and the rays of light broke through the ocean roof. It reminded her of a day at the beach back in California, the waves, how they rocked and moved her beneath the surface, suffocating her in a pleasant silence, the same lights pulsed through the water on that day.
   She could smell something as well, presuming it was coming from the kitchen—peas and chicken she recognised—perhaps tomato soup as well, its scent unclear. Her father must be home.
   She wandered toward the smell, feeling the surfaces of the house, the parts where the walls extended out into shelves, or curved into the wallpaper. There was her painted portrait of her, sitting on a red velvet high chair hung adorn above a neat, stone fireplace. She had sat there for a few hours as the artist ingrained her figure onto the canvas. She kept on going toward the scent, and next to the dining room, through an arch of ebony wood, the kitchen opened up into a bright room with a collection of hanging cooking utensils in almost every corner.

The earlier you get started, the better. I've shared all of my work since the beginning. Even the beginning stuff I wish I could forget. The stuff I wish I could erase from my poor early beta readers' memories. 

I'm now numb to feeling discouraged by heavy criticism or negative comments. I apply criticism and move forward. That's why I'm confident in my ability to a cocky point, even though I've only been writing for around 4 years.

The criticism feedback loop is the most important method of improvement, second to only the act of writing itself. After you have acknowledged or realized that your story suffers from a certain issue, it's inexcusable for that issue to be present in your future rewrites or stories. 

As we write more and more, and recieve more and more critique, we're whittling down some big ugly marvel block. Soon, it will be a statue with few obvious blemishes. Then, you'll polish that statue. As the biased father of that piece of art, you will glance over flaws obvious to others, and you'll think it's much better than it actually is. 

But strangers will walk by, point at it, and mention ""Isn't its nose upside down?"" 

And then you'll look at it and say ""Holy shit. It's nose is upside down.""

I can recall tons of issues I've had in the past that I've become aware of and fixed only due to my earliest, trashiest work being criticized. They're now gone.

Formatting and grammar issues. Unnatural Shakespeare-like dialgue. Too much detail. Disgustingly terrifyingly bad usage of adverbs. Too much cliche and cheese. More cliche and cheese. 

I wouldn't have become aware of these issues in my early chapters so fast if I didn't send them out to my poor friends and acquaintances, expecting praise for my obviously amazing and totally not shit work."

But somehow, the general public (especially Reddit) absolutely adores end verse rhythm used in the cheesiest ways.

Anyway, ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a writer. I quickly fell in love with paranormal romance and that's been my niche. It's what I write best, but my parents who like to control parts of my life, do not like it.

When I was younger, I would write in my notebooks before I had my own laptop. My mother would snoop in them without permission, then sit me down and say ""you can't write this"" ""werewolves and magic are bad"" and on and on about why I should not write what I am writing.

I tried to dive into other genres like mystery but not only could I not get real motivated in, but my writing was not as good as my romance, so through the years up until my current age-26- I have been keeping my writing in secret.

But they still try to delve into matters that are not theirs and continue to control me. Saying things like ""you should listen to people around you like us so you won't ruin your reputation"" when talking about my writing. That they felt bad about discouraging me from writing but then turn around and spew their thoughts about what I should or should not do. 

Not only this but also their control in my own romantic life (read my previous post) has led to extreme anxiety about following my dreams, and to this day I still struggle with it.

And the last incident was TODAY.

I went out to lunch with my Mom and she was talking about what I can do for my future and said to my face, ""you should write more wholesome stuff not that werewolf junk.""

And when I just stared at her, not sure what to say, she brought in God and honoring him with my writing.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wasn't sure how to reply but in my head, I was thinking, ""it is not werewolf junk. I want to show you that my fantasy can be wholesome love stories.""

And then my fear comes in, my mental health anxiety trying to persuade me that she is right and what I like to write about is wrong.

I HATE THIS.

Writing fantasy fiction as a person who is Christian isn't bad. I'm not a vulgar writer who writes about pre-marriage sex. I love vampires and romance and I want to get my own stories out there. Ones that promote love and that will show that I can honor God with my writing.

I just hate having to struggle with not only my fears but also with my parents who still try to control me. I want to follow my dreams but I am scared of how they will react and what others will think of me.

Well, most folks would be familiar with tabletop RPGs in the form of games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc. These roleplaying games place you into the role of a character in a fantastic world and ask you ""What do you want to do?"" Whether they count as 'collaborative storytelling' devices in and of themselves is a topic of no small debate in the tabletop community, but they can lead to some amazing group storytelling at the table.

However, these games require at least one or more players, as well as a game master (or dungeon master if playing D&amp;D) to actually run the game. They are a group experience.

There exists another breed of roleplaying games that still place you in the role of a person in a fantastic world, but they use tools and a little imagination (as well as patience) to replace the role of the game master and allow you to explore on your own.

**Why would a solo tabletop RPG help a writer build their world or story?**

The kinds of tools from some of the popular solo RPG tools out there can act as a system of randomization, often tempered by things like the likelihood of something happening, that can help a writer navigate interesting plot points or dream up new ones altogether, all within the context of a game. I'll detail some examples below, but for now, you can use these tools to play with plot outlines, dream up new scenes, or play out fledgling ideas you might have to consider possibilities within an actual framework.

Looking at your world and your plot through the lens of the solo roleplaying game can lend solidity to your perspective, putting scaffolding around your rampant imagination and helping to ask the question, ""What would really happen next?""

There are even solo RPGs that focus solely on worldbuilding, offering the chance to see your setting through the eyes of someone IN that place.

**Two examples of solo tabletop RPGs for writers**

*A quick note on the games below, none of these are affiliate links. The only one I am associated with is Journey, which I created myself.*

**Mythic** is one of the big players in the solo roleplaying game world, and for good reason. The system was built originally as its own standalone game but has since released something called the [Mythic Game Master Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator). Essentially, this emulator offers a set of tools and frameworks to allow you to pair it with any tabletop roleplaying game and run sessions without a game master. This means you can step into any game (Dungeons and Dragons for example) with any setting and play. It works great as a replacement game master, for solo play and groups, but it can *also* be used by writers and world builders to move through your own stories and settings. 

Mythic uses something they call the Fate Chart, a chart that blends dice results and probabilities (along with the likelihood of chaotic things happening, a mechanic they go more into in the book) to answer yes/no questions. From the standpoint of a writer, this lets you consider the current situation in your setting and plot, ask questions about the action and story, and get interesting semi-randomized answers that are nevertheless informed by probability and chaos.

*You can find the Mythic Game Master Emulator on DriveThruRPG at* [*https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator)*, along with a ton of other Mythic tools for creating RPG adventures, creatures, and game locations.*

[**Journey**](https://graycastlegames.itch.io/journey) is a solo roleplaying game developed with a number of writers and game masters in the process, created to place you in the shoes of an explorer within your setting. It's an exercise in imagination that lets you find new places, people, points of interest and story hooks within any setting. The game walks you through the process of choosing your Setting, as well as for deciding on the kind of physical form you will take while moving through this world. You can use existing settings, the worlds you've created for your own books, or even specific locations and buildings as your Setting.

Then, using game-style mechanics and no tools more complicated than a six-sided die and a deck of playing cards, Journey takes you through a number of points of interest, called Waypoints, and gives you a framework to 'zoom in' to specific Aspects of those Waypoints. A Waypoint can be a pretty broad range of things, like historical places, individual people, and places of social gathering in the Setting. At the end of a session, players will have a Traveler's Journal full of inspiration to take back to their writing or worlds.

[Journey](https://graycastlegames.itch.io/journey) was developed as a different kind of solo roleplaying game that eschews some of the attempts to replicate the action of a group RPG and instead focuses on generating inspiration, entertainment, and ideas out of the world around you. It's a distillation of a process I've used for years in my own projects, and from the feedback, has been pretty amazing for gamers and writers alike.

*Journey is pretty new, and available on itch.io at* [*https://graycastlegames.itch.io/journey*](https://graycastlegames.itch.io/journey)*. There are often a number of free Community Copies available, as I know this has been a shitty year and I want folks to be able to enjoy Journey even if finances don't allow a purchase. These have been going FAST, but are getting restocked pretty regularly.*

***Final thoughts on solo tabletop RPGs for writers***

While I only touched on two examples, there are a TON of really amazing solo roleplaying games out there. Journey itself was inspired by [Artefact](https://mouseholepress.itch.io/artefact) by Jack Harrison and [Alone Among the Stars](https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars) by Takuma Okada. Many games are focus primarily on the action of a more traditional roleplaying game, but these two and [Journey](https://graycastlegames.itch.io/journey) are focused on story, and are a lot of fun to play.

Have you used solo roleplaying games to try to inform or enhance your writing / worldbuilding? What games have you tried that really worked?"

I have 20 years of one story, one fantasy world in my head, the characters, the relationships.  I believe, I have come to believe, that the story doesn't work. The story and world has changed too much to work. Every time I write I change my mind, I come up with new ideas.

I also know I cannot write anything else not related to this until it's written. I cannot even think about anything else. 

But to build a better world you sometimes have to burn down the old one. 

I cannot keep saying I'm coming up with a different idea/way to tell the story then reuse chapters from my previous idea to save time. Yes it's the same character in the same position in both ways, but the idea, and execution is still different. The reader might not know the difference, but I do, and that brings it to a halt. 

There is no way I can write something new while still holding onto the old ways. 

I have to change. 

I think perhaps it is time to delete all I have written so far and start from the ground up. To take what I have previously written as a kind of lesson. I have learned to write better than how I started. It is time to begin again, to start anew. To not rely on the past. 

It is the only way. No one will mourn the loss of the work. No one has read it but me."

430,Jeldreen,Advice,6,writing,1615987628,"I wrote the first book of what's going to be a trilogy. But it's a genre I've never written in and I don't know if the whole plot is fine or if it feels like ""nothing happened."" I feel unable to judge it myself It's a space fantasy set in the future where the plot is dragged forward by a love story and by the protagonist's mistakes, basically. So a space fantasy romance? I don't know.

My doubt comes from the fact that like... There's not much action or fight scenes or you know, stuff like that. And this makes me insecure that it may feel like nothing happened. 

I mean, the whole plot of the first book turns around the protagonist that's been hiding for her whole life and is now undercover as a trainee in a sort of military academy because her genoma has something that the villain™ wants, but he's still mysterious/nowhere to be found. Here there is mr asshole™ and I'm building a haters-to-lovers dynamics with him which will end at the end of book 3. There are several plot twists, like the team™ of the villain™ finds out who and where the protagonist is, mr asshole™ turns out to be a former supporter of the villain™ that has been working as a double agent for some time now and basically book 1 ends with the return into action of the villain™, mr asshole™ having to join him, the uncovering of the protagonist's identity and a new departure because she can't hide at the academy anymore.

I summed it up as poorly as I could. Like, there is no great battle or anything. Just a tension building up of how many things could go wrong and how difficult things are about to get in later books, I suppose, but for the most part the plot is led by the protagonist's mistakes and learning about herself. I'm insecure. I mean, I know that when the trilogy will be done, there's going to be a lot of action and sh*t happening involved, but I'm afraid this first book can be perceived as a ""nothing happened"" for the standards of a science fiction/space fantasy. I don't know, am I just overthinking? Also if anyone feels like giving me a deeper advice about the plot I can go into more detail in DM. Thank you!"

I shared polished drafts of the first two chapters with a friend to beta read. His feedback was useful but it also confirmed some of my own suspicions. I have the sinking feeling that this book starts in chapter 3, which I'm working on now. Either that or the first two chapters will need to be cut down to a fraction of what they are.

**-&gt;** The feeling of all that work going out the window feels incredibly disheartening. I know I shouldn't think of it as wasted time. I try to tell myself that it's all *training*, that even if I'm taking a longer route, I'll still get to where I need to go.

But I have history with this. I spent *so* long on my last novel that I couldn't let go of it even though it wasn't working. Just kept trying to fix it, fix it, fix it. When I eventually shared it with a friend... awkward silence. No constructive feedback. I lost confidence after that and it took my years before I could move on to a new project. That definitely felt like wasted time.

So although I'm only three chapters into this attempt, there's a voice inside me saying: ""Not again!"" I think because I spent so long on those first chapters, it has already raised the stakes and now I'm questioning my judgment.

Does anyone have any advice for navigating this?

438,JustOneLazyMunchlax,Discussion,3,writing,1615982515,"Authors using Death to escape hard choices - Love Triangles specifically So, I was watching a TV Series yesterday and it involved a Love triangle in the first season. From the moment I got the details, I made a quick prediction and it turned out to be right.

I don't mean the ""Two people in love and one person loves someone in the couple."" I mean the, three people where you can easily imagine one of them ending with either of the other, due to them loving both, perhaps in different ways.

So, I saw a Female MC in a relationship with an ""It's complicated"" relationship with an Ex. I took one look at their situation and said... ""Boyfriend dies, she ends up with the Ex."" Surprise Surprise, that's what happened.

Why is it, that the common choice I find in literature I read, or media I watch, that when dealing with a character that has to choose between loving one person or another, the author decides to forego ever making an actual choice and simply kills off one of them? Either the kill inspires growth, or one sacrifices their life.

Why do I rarely seem to see the middle party just make a choice, determine who they love more or simply vacating the scenario because they can't choose? About the only time I ever really see choice factor in is when the middle party wasn't truly in love with one and it was easy. I don't recall ever seeing a tough choice in this regard.

&amp;#x200B;

And while unrelated to Love Triangles, I also see death as an escape for Character Redemption. Bad guy redeems himself by dying for the cause, or he dies from wounds etc. A character who, has done things so bad that even if they turn around, people will still want them dead, as if the author doesn't want to deal with the moral quandary that is, how should we treat someone that deserves and doesn't deserve to die simultaneously?"

Anyways

So, around six months ago, I've sent my book (a sci-fi adventure) to various publishers and today I finally received an answer for one relatively small publishing house I was really eager to work with. 

And yeah... *""Unfortunately, your manuscript didnt manage to convince the entirety of our reading comity. Thus, we cannot envision its publication.""*

As you can guess, not the best thing to wake up to. It kinda brings the mood down for the day. Naturally. Oh, I'll get over it, but I was really eager to work with these guys.

Still, I sent a mail back, asking if it was possible to have some more feedback and criticism...

And they obliged (that's really nice of them, they truly didnt have to).

**- The story lacks action sequences.**

**- Too many characters, which can be confusing.**

**- The ending feels strange and rushed.** 

**- That being said, they found the overall story and the writing style quite pleasing.**

I’m writing a glossary for one of my work’s software products. The glossary will be a component of the software’s user help guide. In the glossary, I want to cover all the unusual product-specific terms. 

Thing is, there are A LOT of unusual product-specific terms. If I include all these terms, I might end up with 10+ pages and I think that’s too excessive. So, as a work around, these are my glossary rules:
– Only include terms that appear commonly (more than once).
– Don’t include terms that appear only once. About 95% of terms that only appear once are specific fields. So, if the user wants more information about the term (field), they should visit the associated topic in the help guide.
– Name the glossary “Glossary of Commonly Used Terms” in spite of the above rule.
– Don’t include terms that are self-describing or obvious.

What do you think about this approach? Is this reasonable?

448,weirdwriterr, ,7,writing,1615975101,"How do you write whilst listening to more energetic songs? I used to write with no music at all, no tea, no routine -- I would just sit down and start typing away. Recently I found a new routine which includes playing music in the background whilst writing my novel, and, personally, I find listening to music a great way to get into the mood for writing.

Now, before I get into the main topic I want to discuss with you all I would first like to put a little disclaimer before: I do not dislike rock/punk/metal, in fact I grew up listening to Green Day, Radiohead and am recently quite interested by Yungblud. I also do not dislike the people who listen to these genres of music whilst trying to write, I am fascinated by it more than anything else and wish to understand it more. Now, without further ado, let me begin.

In the first paragraph I talked about listening to music whilst writing, which is a new enjoyment of mine, and how beneficial I believe it can be to writers and novelists alike. I get ready for writing, which usually starts with a cup of tea, sit down on my desk and, before writing, play music. The music varies from period to period: classical, Ryo Fukui jazz, lighter tracks by Radiohead and Phoebe Bridgers and Ichiko Aoba's stunning Windswept Adan album. However recently I've been enjoying jazz revamps of Studio Ghibli soundtracks, based off the works by the eternally talented composer Joe Hisaishi.

&amp;#x200B;

The music I listen to when not working varies, but when writing it always stays in the same lane: light tracks that seep into the background. The main reason I listen to these types of tracks and albums is because I cant concentrate with rock n' roll or lyric based songs, as I find it blends in my writing mindset or just makes it impossible for me to focus. I find a lot of people are like me, who enjoy listening to music whilst writing, but, what I personally found shocking, is that a lot of the music people listen to whilst writing is of the metal/rap/rock/punk genre.

One of the most famous examples of this is Stephen King, who has stated that he listens to bands such as Metallica and Anthrax whilst writing. I understand that some people who listen to music whilst writing like to surround themselves with the same atmosphere that would be in their novel, but this still doesn't answer why they will play the same genre all the time. 

I would love to know from people who listen to rock/punk/metal etc. whilst writing if they just generally find it easier to fade out that genre of music more-so than my preference, mellow, piano, for instance, and why? Thank you."

Is this too much new information to dump on the reader in chapter one? I feel like in order for the reader to understand one thing, they need a little bit of the other thing.

Also, I do not go into full explanation about these bullet points. The reader just gets tiny thoughts or conversations relating to them, so that they have to keep on reading to the next chapter to find out more."

I have a set amount of time that I write for every day, and I chose this specific time because it’s when I’m not needed by anyone else. The only problem is that my family is still consistently interrupting me.

I’ve got a pretty fragile train of thought and am very easily distracted so if I get interrupted even once while trying to write, it completely derails things and I lose whatever flow I had going. I’m starting to get pretty frustrated and upset about it because writing this story is really important to me, and my ability to focus is not the best so I’m working really hard to stay on track.

I’ve tried talking to my family about these interruptions in the nicest way possible but I don’t think they take it very seriously. They support my writing and everything but none of them are the ‘creative types’, so they tend to misunderstand or disregard my work process. They think I can just churn out chapters as simply as putting words on a page without any thought or effort whatsoever. They don’t understand that being interrupted is a massive hindrance to me and makes it extremely difficult to get anything done.

I don’t expect them to tiptoe around me because that’d be unfair, but at the very least I expect them to respect that I’ve set aside time to write uninterrupted and have given them plenty of notice beforehand.

Does anybody else have any experience with this? Do you have any advice on how to not let things like this set my progress and productivity back? I’ve been massively procrastinating writing this story for so long but I’m finally putting real effort into it and that effort keeps on getting punched in the face by my family asking to borrow things every 20 minutes."

484,OlanValesco,Discussion,3,writing,1615965866,"Lepus ex machina The phrase *deus ex machina* (god from the machine) comes from old Greek plays (I know it's Latin, bear with me) where they would resolve conflict by popping a god onstage via crane or rising platform. It's generally regarded as a choice way to take a steaming dump on your own plot.

I'd like to propose another phrase: *lepus ex machina*, rabbit from the machine. Furthering the plot/conflict by presenting an unforeshadowed event. If you were at a play that had nothing to do with animals, and they randomly lowered a rabbit onto the stage and the characters started interacting with it, you would be confused (unless it's a comedy, then you might be delighted).

**Where *deus ex* is about unforeshadowed resolution, *lepus ex* is about unforeshadowed conflict.** I don't think it's inherently a negative, as *deus ex* is considered to be.

### Initial thoughts

- Early on, you can **only** create conflict via *lepus ex*, as nothing can be expected yet.
- The further you get into a plot, the worse *lepus ex* becomes when implemented.
- Consequently, standard advice would prescribe that you avoid *lepus ex* after the 50% mark.
- If you've foreshadowed a stuffed rabbit but deliver an actual rabbit, that's not *lepus ex*, that's exceeding expectations.

There are several ways to give yourself project closure at the end of a writing day:

1. When you do feel like writing, write a raw piece or perfect a previously written raw and unpolished piece. 

2. When you don’t feel like writing on a writing day, come up with all the concepts you need for the next writing day so that there’s minimum pausing and thinking and steady progress.

3. Also when you don’t feel like writing on a writing day, watch a movie or TV show or read a book that gets you into the zone for your own story and keeps the grand plans around it alive in your head.

4. Further detail the overarching structure of your plot and/or character arc

5. Celebrate every form of project closure at the end of each writing day with something that takes the stress off.

I've been writing stories for as long as I remember but when depression rose its ugly head about ten years ago I've since struggled to write anything. The only times I have been able to write was when I felt like everything in my life was going right for once, which, naturally, doesn't last.

Right now my depression is particularly severe. I'm taking my meds and seeing my psychologist regularly, but as good as she is, she's not a creative so can only understand how I feel with regards to my writing from an abstract point of view and from other patients she sees.

The difference between now and other severe bouts is that as my interest in other things wanes, my interest and urge to write has increased. But somehow I still just... Can't. I don't even know why, I have the story, the characters, the world, nearly everything is there (minus a few points here or there) either written down or in my head. But it's like there's this physical barrier preventing me from putting pen to page. I'm not afraid or wanting it to be perfect, perfectionism has never mattered much to me and I'm past the point where I care if it's ever published or not. I've even already started it so it's not the blank page syndrome.

Does anyone else get this feeling? I don't really have writer friends who I can ask. Do you have any idea how to get past it and actually write something? Useful tips and tricks or bribes?"

And I'm worried that my stories are boring because I can't seem to get invested in anything but the smut. I have infinite energy to write about sex but other plot elements feel impossible.

The obvious thing I could do is go back to writing erotica. But it just really wasn't scratching the itch for me. I switched over to romance because I learned that I love having the characters develop a relationship. One of the best things I've ever written was a series of erotic shorts that followed the same couple. I realized after all of them were written that I kind of had made a pseudo romance. It was just that the romance started with sex, the characters developed through sex, and then it ended on more sex.

But now that I'm writing real romance, I'm finding it really difficult to slog through. I suppose I could write romances that are mostly made up of sex scenes. I've read some that were structured that way. But they weren't very good."

Whereas the dizzardly *Kleshavarana* (poison of emotional clashes) and *Jneyavarana* (poison of misperception) overlords give the rabble the bob as yarely as they may, down *dans le panneau* of venomous deception’s nayward, sure neither will a wise *upashika* let himself be overcome by such nefarious grief, nor needs strive therewith sacrificing injudiciously his natural peace, since in one muggy and overly high-altitude rainforest of tortuous tracks thatched with awns and thistles of *elaphandra*\-type worts rendered slaked a-scabrous moist of reek notwithstanding, at wanst one has already ha' come a cropper, the seeker he shall not everyway go.

So, as a result of these mountainous tracks successfully lithed, thou prudently endeavourest to usher thyself into the Tayos’ Sacred Caves that, at the almost invious and untrodden farness, its surrounding vegetation is richly supplied of tree brackens (*helechos arborescentes*) and dumb-canes (viz., *Dieffenbachia meleagris*) together with waterlogged *vejucos* comprised by groovy understoreys and ditch-shaped shrubs.

Thou hence inceptest to walk through the Cave’s nethermost halls, plenty of golden obelisks and pillars that are thoroughly ornamented by galvanized shards of goblet containing the Empyrean Nectar (or Fluid) in their interstice, which play the role of electrodes with sundry millions of volts onto those of other monoliths and conversely, configuring an unlimited electricity network to the stow.

In the midst of the wandering, asudden, a voice divinely boisterous clepes thee, and asks thee for being ready to stand face-to-face to the Sacred Cave’s Superior Beings, i.e., dæmons and angels, at their uppermost *Bhadra*, when it be the right stound. Thence, thou farest towards them with thy highest strength and worldwidsom, being thy compass, the holy *lieu* and art of finding the Truth. Yet, also asudden, the electricity ceases to work, Light is given harsh decession, and the powers that be of Darkness step into the stage, actuating plump in wearing away the substrata of the barrow of thy Cosmic Consciousness.

So the greater hardship (*Dukha*) goes to subdue thee, bears sway thy soul in becoming thee fore-slowed to go on roaming through the cavernous ever so burdensome itinerary, evil-willingly making thee faltering at virtually any step given and breath insufflated, and abruptly thou art at such void and dullness thou hardly can realize thou art somewhere or even art. Henceforth, even keeping a stalwart willpower to achieve thy Sublime Goal of Buddhahood, thou layest thyself sheer prone to wend at worst thy state of living (*Ferch*), anchored by a forthcoming life sublation at such dismal scæne. Astonishingly though, when thou art virtually succumbed unto Darkness, an ember-shaded flitting blaze splendidly appears facing thee, self-vanishing anon, and, thereby, insofar as thou beknowest who and when thou art, thou thus becomest eventually able to behold the Sacred Cave’s angels and dæmons, sat upon their opulent thrones at the peak of too-luminescent dripstones-underlain karsts.

Under the command of the Almighty Voice, the angels shall bestow thee the philosopher’s stone whose boundless knowledge thou shalt be acquainted with, and the dæmons the holier flame whereby thy protection will be for aye guaranteed, like that of the divine soothsayer-warriors, wherefore overcoming all fears and disgraces, and standing stronger and mightier. Feeling the great spiritual ecstasy flowing over thy body, heart, and soul, until it comes forth upon thy mind and therefrom is irradiated everywhere, thou shalt have received the consecration of the Paramount Enlightenment. And we, hail thee, hail thee! —, altogether*, tat tvam asmi*: a Buddha, a Hermes, a Kukulcan, a Quetzacoátl: the Cosmic Man!

The early arc ends whit the MC defeating  some enemies who are of interest to him and front that point the enemies are turned into POV characters  observing the MC to learn about him, the plot returns to the enemies to move out of they troubles in a big way but affer the climax of they troubles they still need to undestand more about the situation that is happening in the area and now the story goes more directly over the MC, the time calms down while stuff happens as the MC knows he must stay quiet and goes into minor work to show the kinda conections he can make,      Ocasionally setting up a shotgun for the latter plot but generally triying to move along other characters.

I wonder if there is a better way to curve the narrative, i intent so the story dont go a ""weak to strong"" or ""litte to big villain"" way but more on the ""growing personalitys crash"", more like in wrestling.

Reading through literature and seeing motifs that pose truly interesting questions is great for me, things like the promises of authority in Orwell, or what defines civilisation in Golding, etc etc. What ideas interest you? It could be literally anything. A mythological allusion I could incorporate, like Orpheus or Tantalus, and its accompanying questions, a psychological thing, like confabulation in Molloy, or the Abject in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or maybe just a concept. The monotony of daily life, for example. I want this to be my best work, brimful of allusions, and questions, not vacuous, orotund schlop. So, tell me what you're interested in.

Are these writers failures? 

No. They get to write what they want for a living. They have published books that are available to a wide variety of people. They must have some sort of fanbase if their books are in big stores.

Taste is subjective. Being an author who is a household name is 1 in a million. That goes down to luck."

That has always been the way I write, never anything long term. But there's this one idea I haven't been able to let go of.

It's the same thing. I start writing, and then I get bored and move on to another idea. But eventually, I move back to that one storyline and I delete my old work and start again. I swear I have at least four or five starts to the same story, the longest only about 50 pages. I don't know how to write this story, but I don't know how to get rid of it either.

But I’ve decided screw that, I don’t want to regret not trying and not writing anything, even if it goes nowhere. So I’ve gathered some of my better ideas for short stories and have begun writing, but I have questions, so if you want to answer one or both of them I’d be extremely grateful for any advice.

The first thing I’ve run into is that some of my earlier ideas seemed cliché, so I revised them, but then I feel like those are cliché too. It seems like everything is cliché to some extent because everything has been done before. How do you avoid clichés while still having common human elements in your story? How do you know when something is too cliché and should be avoided?

The other thing is that I feel like I don’t write enough description. I love dialogue; good and interesting dialogue in books to me is absolute gold, but I feel like I tend to have too much. I realize quality over quantity, and I’m trying to achieve quality, but then you pick up some books and it’s like 2 pages straight of just description- scene description, thought description, everything else. I feel like I run out of things to write and then it feels forced, which is never good. Does anyone have any advice for this? How much description is too little, and how do I know when to add more?

So it pretty much tells the main characters' tragic backstory when their parents die (wow I'm so original, i know) and introduces the villains of the story, as well as providing context about the magical world they go to in the third chapter (it's a portal fantasy, and the main protagonist has an old book about the magical world and thinks that it is fiction at first). It's also a dream that the main character wake up from, because her dreams are often flashbacks or hints of what's to come.

Now, the backstory is crucial to the plot, but I was just wondering if it's a bad idea to make a prologue a backstory, and if I should explain the backstory in a different way, as well as what other readers, authors and publishers would think of it Thanks!"

So I'm writing a story about 2 artifacts with magical power.

The first one is a necklace with whistle shaped pendant, let's call it A. When you blow it, it summon a strong warrior to protect you, if you are a girl. I named it ""The Lioness' charm"". I'm happy with the name and the pendant and would like to keep them this way.

The second one is also a necklace, let's call it B. It can grant you a wish. Currently I named it ""Tear of the Goddess"" and have its pendant shaped a water drop. I'm not happy with it and would like to change its name and pendant. This is where I need you guys' help please. 

The reason I want it to be changed is because of an event in the story: 

The main character is seeking for B, and all the info he has are:
- B's name (which is currently ""Tear of the goddess"") 
- B's power
- There is that white knight artifact he does not give a fuck about (A) 

When he found B, it is together with A and the MC need to pick one, the other will be destroyed after that. He made a mistake and pick A instead of B and now stuck with A forever. 

With B's current name and shape, it's stupid for the MC to make such a mistake as you would pick a water drop over a whistle any time, when the damn thing is named ""Tear of the goddess"". So I would like to change the name and shape, to make him a little less stupid. They should satisfy these conditions:

- B's name is iconic to ""wishing"". 
- B's shape resemble the name. 
- The whistle shape should resemble the name too. It would be perfect if a whistle shape makes you think of B's name even more than B's actual shape. 

Here is A's shape in my mind if it's any help: https://www.google.com/url?q=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b5faebe4b04763035addee/5230ae98e4b063d0d51c82fa/552b7e19e4b0ee740dedef91/1595221029172/%3Fformat%3D1500w&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZqvionJfwAhUXy4sBHYdKAxsQ5hMIBTAA&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dunsVypvBy44eIDkT3J2O

How do you go from just that small simple idea and start building a plot around it.   
I'm asking because I'm new to writing and struggling creating a short film. Here is my process so far. In this case the idea I have before my story is a scene:  
1) Think of a cool scene.  
2) Think of a follow up of that scene that I think perfectly goes with the previous one and use it. I can have several different or alternative scenes that I think is a good follow up to the previous scene, all of which will lead to a different outcome of the story. I pick the best or most ideal among them  
3) Repeat step 2 for the next scene till I finish the story for the short film  
The proceed is basically thinking of cool scenes that is a befitting and rational follow up to the previous one. I've now reached a point where I can't progress forward and I'm thinking it is because of this technique I use. So how do you guys go from just a simple idea and create a story from it"

Option A: Cut and file the edges between books so they each feel more as a stand alone even if they're not really that.

Option B: Raw cut. Don't even try to hide it. More so, don't even restart chapter numeration. Part 2 starts from chapter 34. I like to call it the Encyclopedia way.

Which one do you think it's better? 

A: It's safe, it follows the standard rule that each part of a series even if not ideal can be read as a stand alone. But it would involve a lot of reworking, and for me it would feel very artificial and book 3 depends a lot on plot points set in book 1 so is it even worth it?  


B:  It's bold. Has someone ever done it? I can't possibly be the first one to do this, right? right? Please let me know if you know of examples of books who've gone this way to know how it was received!! I can't find any. Books would have to be published practically at the same time, so the reader can pick one book after the other with no wait time whatsoever. It leaves room to a possibly mega special edition if the book ever gets popular.    


For reference, book has already 347,323 words at the moment. so each part would be \~100,000 words (still on the long side, I know!).

I'm writing something that has a story-within-a-story structure where the switching between ""real life"" and the story is not always clearly delineated because of an unreliable narrator who often confuses the two.

The ""real life"" portion consists mainly of a dialogue between two people, while the ""story"" portion is excerpts from novels that one of them wrote.

I'm having trouble thinking of how I should textually differentiate these two narratives. In Rothfuss' ""Name of the Wind,"" for example, he differentiates the two narratives via perspective: the main narrative is told in third person, while Kvote's recollections are told in first person. Given that my framed narrative consists of the character's novels, I can't make use of this technique. Also, I want to be looser with how I switch between the two.

I was thinking something like using italics for the novel excerpts, but given that they will sometimes be several pages long, I think this would be annoying to read. It's also a little too on-the-nose and I think would make the reader notice the technique too much rather than focus on the story.

2. Should I just fictionalise the people (including myself) involved so I can exercise a bit more freedom with the dialogue and not risk potentially offending the actual people in the story or take things out of proportion/context?

Especially if, due to the general plot, the story of the second book is just like a less exciting version of the first book (going on a journey to save someone) which isn't idle.

I notice that first books or films of series always have that weird first-one magic, and second books sometimes go a bit stale.
I've tried to make my second book richer emotionally, which didn't work, it was over dramatic and too short, I tried to just write it normally, but then it was boring, like the skeleton of a story with no feeling, and I tried to develop the narrator by showing what they were thinking but then it was boring in a different way, just going on about what was going on in there head and looking like therapy writing to anyone who would read it.

Writing is like leaving a trail that the reader is supposed to follow. Think of it like this. You made a feast, but the problem is, the feast is really far away. You've got to find a way to lead the guests to the feast; so you decide on making a bread crumb trail.

Now there are two ways that you can make this trail, both having their own pros and cons.

The first way is by making the trail with bread crumbs evenly spaced out, in perfect intervals. A guest follows this trail, eating their way through. Some miles later, they find a magnificent castle on a hill. The feast waits inside. ""Welcome."" A guard says. ""May I see your ticket?"" So the guest presents his ticket and enters. Low and behold, there is so much food in front of them. All waiting to be devoured, but there's a problem. The guest is too hungry to eat even a single morsel. They spent their precious stomach space on the bread crumb trail, leading to the feast.

The second way is by making the trail sporadic and spaced longer between bread crumbs. A guest follows the trail, eating a bread crumb here and eating a bread crumb there. A few crumbs later, they happen upon a magnificent castle on a hill. The feast waits inside. ""Welcome."" A guard says. ""May I see your ticket?"" The guest presents his ticket and enters. Tables upon tables of food await them, all waiting to be eaten. This guest is so hungry from the journey there and only survived by a few bread crumbs. Now they not only eat to survive but eat to enjoy.

He collected countless souls to grow his power, after that he approached his father and said, “Your reign here is over. It’s time for a new king to take the crown, and that king is me.” Gazar launched an attack at his father, he blocked it and yelled, “Stop this foolishness, you try to take my throne. I am the king of this realm, and you, you are nothing.” Gazar fueled by rage focused all his power and made a powerful strike at his father. It was a direct hit, it knocked him to the ground. In response he cast a spell to trap him inside a small doll. As Gazar was being trapped he uttered. “In a few thousand years’ time I will come back to smeek what’s mine.” His voice faded; he was successfully trapped in the doll.

630,Entituousdragon,Advice,5,writing,1622434154,"Space Story 

I'm writing a story that has to start in space or in the universe(a fictional one) for at least two chapters. I have to describe the stars as hot balls of gases, planets, comets and other stuff. My story is about travelling different universes in the Science Fantasy genre. I know the plot and I already have an end for it. I think it's really good but there's one problem: I don't know how to start it all off. I really need to make the prologue because the first chapter looks awkward without it but I can't seem to start . I tried explaining the background of the universe and the protagonist(considering this again, just need to hone my poetry and description skills) and making a completely different scene that would put some points down without giving too much hint about the story(like a lecture in high school talking about the universe, life, consciousness, etc.) but because I'm just a beginner, I don't really know what to put down to paper yet. I still have classes and exams but its going to end in about a few weeks. I'm planning to write about other things and practice for 1 month before I actually start writing my first story. Would anyone give their honest thoughts and suggestions on what the better choice to do for the prologue is? Can I also have suggestions about what themes are suitable for stories in space? The first message I wanted to give is ""We are not the center of the world"" and the other one is ""We are so insignificant in the eyes of the universe"" but those are supposed to be carried out throughout the whole story. I long for something that can be explicitly said right in the first chapters.

Thank you very!"

So, I need new beta readers. However, I'm stuck in a conundrum. Do I give people the cliff notes of the first book before asking them to read 100,000 words or ask them to read a full 177,000 words?

On top of that, I don't know of anyone in my life willing to do it, so I'll have to find these beta readers through online groups, which sounds like it might make things even harder.

I am nearing the completion of my first book, and I think it is pretty good. I will then submit it for review by Beta readers. And I have a lot of anxiety about this.

It is nit the fear of critique that bothers me, that’s inevitable, it’s the possibility that the work won’t be able to move forward, that they will say my skill level is simply too low to proceed. 

A lot of writing advice says that your first work won’t be any good and that you must write several books before you can make anything approaching quality writing. It says that you shouldn’t become too attached to your first dozen books and be willing to just tuck them away if they don’t work. This advice reminds me of the usual curriculum for learning to draw. A student starts out wanting to draw the amazing things in their head, but the instructor comes along and tells them that they have to “learn the basics.” And then the student will go through a bunch of value studies and anatomy lessons and once they’re absolutely perfect they can draw what they like. 

I think that this method is wrong though. I absolutely believe in the importance of technical skill but for most people that like to draw they didn’t want to spend years doing charcoal sketches and it kills their passion. Personally, I think that one should go back and forth between technical exercises and passion projects. 

And that brings me to my book. I think that for many of us we didn’t start writing because we wanted to write in the abstract but because we had a dream in our heads, a dream of a world we wanted to make real. I set out to bring a specific vision to life with my work, and while I accept that it must change, the idea that I might have to discard it completely terrifies me. 

So, I ask you. Have you experienced these same feelings and if so, how did you deal with them? Can you salvage an inherently flawed project? Is there a way to build technical skill without grinding though a dozen books that you immediately toss in the trash? And finally, what do you think is the best process, to learn technique first, or to follow your passion?"

683,zaxo3000, ,6,writing,1622399875,"Where did all the books go? This is a curious observation about my dad. He's an avid reader in his mid-70s. He reads around 3-4 books a week and has done so for decades. My dad buys books new, and he's fairly agnostic on topics from popular science fiction to crime &amp; mystery, biographies and historical accounts. He'll read almost anything except self-help books; I'm not sure he needs self-help but maybe he does. 

I was over my parents house recently with the kids and thought I'll save some money and grab a bunch of books from my dad to read. (We all know a book habit can get expensive). 

I look around and there's no books. No books anywhere except the one my dad is currently reading on his nightstand. Curious and now digging thru my memories I can't recall where my dad's books are - where they've ever been ever.  

Growing up I borrowed my siblings books (I'm the youngest) and bought my own; I didn't think about my dad's books, even though he's always reading. I mean I didn't think - at all - about his books, only he has new books and sometimes the topics interest me.

So my dad's not home, he's out golfing during my recent visit, I asked my mom, ""where are all the books dad reads?""

She looks at my confused and says ""what do you mean?""
 
I reply, ""all the books he reads, where are they I want to browse them and take some home.""

She laughs at me and says, ""he throws them out when he's done.""

""What?"" 

""Your father doesn't save books, once he's read them he throws them out."" She continues, ""we wouldn't have room in house if he saved his books.""

I'm dumbfounded, but it makes total sense, somehow I spent 40 years of my life not noticing that books don't accumulate in my parents house.

Obviously there's solutions where my dad could have donated the books or given them away to a library, but that's not what he does, he throws them in the trash. New books thrown in the trash after one reading.

Later when he's home I ask why he does this, dad's reason is different from my mother's. He says when he used to travel for work carrying books around was too heavy in his luggage, so he'd buy a book at the airport and toss it out when he was done. Dad would buy another on the return trip and throw it away too. It became a habit after decades of traveling for work. 

So that's my story of trashing books. And as I wrote this I'm noticing it may also be a story of my poor observation skills. Never noticing in house full of avid readers we had no library, just bookshelves in the kid's bedrooms.

Later I talked to my sister - she laughed at me too. ""I used to dig the books out of the trash,"" she says ""but mom stopped me because she didn't want books everywhere."" 

At least she tried."

Got some time writing some small histories mostly to myself or for my close ones to judge. most of these histories were pretty grounded in reality and, since they were short, I'd rarely have to come up with more than 5 main characters to name.

Recently, I started dwelling on Science Fiction writing and, about 5 months ago, decided to first attempt a full 400+ page book(the stories I wrote before had between 30 - 80 pages).

And now I figured out something. Naming characters and things like ships or cities is hard, really really hard. I can pinpoint my difficulties to 2 things:

First is that in writing a large sprawling story I invested way more thought in my main characters. So I keep getting unsatisfied with how their names match their personalities and their porpouse.

Second is that, in science fiction, I keep trying to adapt the names to the setting and the culture I inserted these characters in. How do I make something feel new and different but, at the same time, human? This got especially difficult when trying to name extraterrestrial ""things"" in the story.

There is just one thing I haven't figured out. Obviously, an integral part of every query letter is an excerpt from the beginnning of the story.

Now, I wrote those two little paragraphs that I put before the first chapter, which reflect back on the themes of my novel, but are not directly related to the plot. You could leave them out and the book would still be perfectly fine, but they set the tone and create a thoughtful and poetic opening.

I love those paragraphs and I want them to be in the final manuscript, but I don't know if I should include them in my query, or leave them out and just start at chapter one.

698,DiscombobulatedFly64,Advice,3,writing,1622390777,"11 Smart Tips for Brilliant Writing &amp;#x200B;

**Do you sound smarter when you use big words?**

According to a study published in [*Applied Cognitive Psychology*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10990720), the answer is no.

In fact, complex writing makes you sound small-minded. Just consider the title of the study: *Consequences of erudite vernacular utilized irrespective of necessity: problems with using long words needlessly.*

Wouldn’t it be better to title this study something like *The effect of using big words when you don’t need them?*

To sound smart, you must stop *trying* to sound smart. Brilliant writing is simple writing, a relevant idea delivered clearly and directly.

Here are 11 ways you can start sounding brilliant:

## 1. Have something to say

This makes writing easier and faster. When you have nothing to say, you are forced to write sentences that sound meaningful but deliver nothing.

Read widely. Take notes. Choose your subjects wisely. Then share your information with readers.

## 2. Be specific

Consider two sentences:

&gt;*I grow lots of flowers in my back yard.*  
*I grow 34 varieties of flowers in my back yard, including pink coneflowers, purple asters, yellow daylilies, Shasta daisies, and climbing clematis.*

Which is more interesting? Which helps you see my backyard?

## 3. Choose simple words

Write *use* instead of *utilizing*, *near* instead of *close proximity*, *help* instead of *facilitating*, *for* instead of *in the amount of*, *start* instead of *commencing*.

Use longer words only if your meaning is so specific no other words will do.

## 4. Write short sentences

You should keep sentences short for the same reason you keep paragraphs short: they’re easier to read and understand.

Each sentence should have one simple thought. More than that creates complexity and invites confusion.

## 5. Use the active voice

In English, readers prefer the SVO sentence sequence: Subject, Verb, Object. This is the active voice.

For example:

&gt;*Passive sentences bore people.*

When you reverse the active sequence, you have the OVS or passive sequence: Object, Verb, Subject.

For example:

&gt;*People are bored by passive sentences.*

You can’t always use the active voice, but most writers should use it more often.

## 6. Keep paragraphs short

Look at any newspaper and notice the short paragraphs.

That’s done to make reading easier because our brains take in information better when it’s broken into small chunks.

In academic writing, each paragraph develops one idea and often includes many sentences. But in casual, everyday writing, the style is less formal and paragraphs may be as short as a single sentence or even a single word.

See?

## 7. Eliminate fluff words

Qualifying words, such as *very*, *little*, and *rather*, add nothing to your meaning and suck the life out of your sentences.

For example:

&gt;*It is very important to basically avoid fluff words because they are rather empty and sometimes a little distracting.*

Mark Twain suggested that you should “Substitute *damn* every time you’re inclined to write *very*; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.”

## 8. Don’t ramble

Rambling is a big problem for many writers. Not as big as some other problems, such as affordable health insurance or the Middle East, which has been a problem for many decades because of disputes over territory. Speaking of which, the word “territory” has an interesting word origin from *terra*, meaning earth.

But the point is, don’t ramble.

## 9. Don’t be redundant or repeat yourself

Also, don’t keep writing the same thing over and over and over. In other words, say something once rather than several times. Because when you repeat yourself or keep writing the same thing, your readers go to sleep.

## 10. Don’t overwrite

This is a symptom of having too little to say or [*too much ego*](https://copyblogger.com/writing-and-ego/).

Put your reader first. Put yourself in the background. Focus on the message.

For example:

&gt;*You can instantly and dramatically improve your blog writing skills and immediately explode your profits and skyrocket your online success by following the spectacular, simple, and practical tips found in this groundbreaking new free blog post.*

## 11. Edit ruthlessly

Shorten, delete, and rewrite anything that does not add to the meaning. It’s okay to write in a casual style, but don’t inject extra words without good reason.

To make this easier, break your writing into three steps:

1. Write the entire text.
2. Set your text aside for a few hours or days.
3. Return to your text fresh and edit.

None of us can ever be perfect writers, and no one expects us to be. However, we can all improve our style and sound smarter by following these tips and writing naturally.

Hi all, so my fantasy book is about a world that contains seven countries based on the seven colors of the rainbow. The first book in a planned series features the Realms of Blue and Green. The blue King takes inspiration from the powerful ocean, so he wants to dominate everything, whereas the green King likes the environment and wants to preserve nature. They are locked in an ancient battle. For example in an attempt to weaken Green, Blue has sent his agents to Earth to start the industrial revolution thereby polluting the greenery and bolstering his own power. Blue has produced cars in the world of the Color Realms (which exists in parallel to Earth), while Green won’t allow his precious rainforest to be touched. A mortal boy is summoned from Earth to fight in the war between these two opposing ideologies.

My question is, would such blatant political themes sit well with the reader? This is for middle reader (or maybe at the most young adult), and most good fiction of this genre that I’ve read doesn’t really get into any theme that is directly tied to any current political debate, or even anything that directly ties into the real world.

She then got to her knees, reached inside her jacket pocket, pulled the bloodied gun she had just stolen from the only man she knew she’d ever love, and pointed it to that aching spot deep within her chest. “You never really loved me…” She sobbed, as the weapon came alive within her trembling hands. “But I have always loved you.”

The discussion HAS been had, yes, but each time we have it, we include new voices and opinions. I also don't think it's been had specifically for the reason I'm asking. I've read past discussions and have some good insights but wanted to get another round in before deciding for myself.

For context, my traditional publishing journey is up and running and I have to make a decision. I'm a white male so I'm feeling pressure (mostly from myself) to consider using initials to leave SOME ambiguity. Maybe I'm overthinking it and maybe agents and publishers are still willing to print books written by white men.

I'm okay with outer flaws since I have many of my own... I'm not saying I'm perfect in internal flaws (it's always hard to see your own flaws you know). It might also be that in on the autistic spectrum on why I have so many troubles with this. So maybe someone can help me with finding character flaws with my Protagonist Eruka. I feel if she has too many negatives she'll be unlikable. This might also be a problem. 

Grammar and spelling aren't my strong suits so sorry in advance.

In Eruka's society a child going into school are given three tests. One for IQ (important in their sociey), character and power potential. Any child who gets the highest marks in these tests are canditates for the next Head Researcher (their ruler). 

Of course Eruka does well on these three tests and is now the only canditate for the next head researcher. However, this doesn't make her spoiled or favored in the community. She grew up with doubt thrown her way at every turn. She grew up under this pressure making her isolated and much weaker than other people her age from the constant fear that she'll disappoint everyone around her.

Finally she has enough and decides she can live under the microscope all her life or do something so grand that it gets the people off her back forever. She decides the best way to do this is study their ancient War Machines. Since the tomes to make them were lost to time, Eruka tasks herself to find how they work and make new ones since the old ones are breaking down and wearing out. 

Her work doesn't go unnoticed though and people still talk poorly on her as she does this... 

This is also just part one of the book. So when Cynric comes to take the machines and kills everyone else, since she didn't get a chance to prove herself, it's a devistating blow. 

I'm not sure what kind of flaws other than the generic fear of failure there could be."

Yesterday in a post someone said they thought MC stood for master of ceremonies. So u/tylerbrainerd responded with a humorous 4 line rap about MC orphan:


*Yo I'm MC orphan*

*and I'm here to say*

*I have a mysterious origin*

*it'll help save the day*


Well I thought this little rap was awesome and wanted to build off it. I was just going to reply with another 4 lines, but things got out of control and I ended up with a ton of additional verses.

The thing is, writing this rap was kind of like writing a simplified and super fun outline for a story. And now I’m thinking this might be a viable way to outline any story.

Since it’s in verse it keeps things concise and it also keeps you focused on the story at hand because each line of the rap is so important that it’s hard to stray off course into digressions. It keeps you on track and always moving forward. And it’s fun too. Which is a big plus. 

Anyway, I think I might give it a try to outline my next story and see. The outline process moves quickly so not much to lose just to give it a try. Here is what I wrote building off u/tylerbrainerd rap as an example:

*Yo I'm MC orphan*

*and I'm here to say*

*I have a mysterious origin*

*it'll help save the day*


My parents were killed

By a big blast of light

I was only a baby

But I remember the night


It was dark and stormy

Wolves howling outside

Mom tucked me in

Dad right by her side


When out of the shadows

A black figure appeared

And in a flash of light 

Mom and Dad disappeared!


Now all I have left of them

Is this golden locket

Chain’s busted though

So I keep it in my pocket


I was put on the doorstep 

of a mean old man

He makes me scrub the house

till it’s spic and span


School kids all tease me

And the teachers are mean

I build robot friends out of junk 

To help me keep the house clean 


Today is my birthday

Just turned twelve

Mean old man forgot it

But it’s just as well


In my creepy attic bedroom 

I reach in my pocket

Light my bedside candle

And I open up the locket


Photos of Mom and Dad

I give each a teary kiss

Their faces smile up at me

As I make my birthday wish...


The window blows open

And snuffs out the candle

My locket snaps shut

It’s too hot to handle


Glowing bright blue

it whirls in mid air

Creating a portal

to God knows where


My bed starts to shake

Books fall from their shelves

Now out of the portal 

Drop two tiny elves


Twin brother and sister

Tryden and Wyntance

When one starts to speak 

The other finishes the sentence


Back and forth they go

telling a terrible tale 

Of monsters and bloodshed 

And of the one called Darknale


Their world is in danger

They’ve come for my aid

But I’m just a kid

No you’re not, you’re a Mage


They hop on my shoulders 

And tell me to leap

The portal is closing

It’s starting to beep


I take a deep breath

As I make up my mind

I jump in the portal

Leaving my old life behind"

For a short summary; This group of people who live on an island is betrayed by a greedy former ally who wants access to their technology. But the technology is only accessible by the island people, so they tried everything they could to make it accessible to themselves, but it did not work. They invaded their island and captured almost all of the people. A lot of the islands culture was destroyed during that time; as well as lots of people passed away from the brutality of it. The captured people came together and gave one last fight against the colonists (I'm not sure if this is the right word to use or not) and were able to retake their island. This happening is a major part of their history and hundreds of years later they're still recovering from it.

752,QEDthis,Resource,3,writing,1625580190,"Had my best writing day in a long, long while. It was an immersive journaling/introspection technique that did it for me. I’m one of those people who roll their eyes when they hear “writer’s block.” To me it just means you don’t know your material well enough. So, if I feel stuck, I try to find out the gaps in my knowledge that prevent me from continuing and try to fill them with research or deeper thinking. That usually does the trick for me.

But with lockdown and all, I’ve struggled with something different. It’s been nearly impossible for me to get into flow and write from that place where I feel connected to myself and to my writing. I do the work all right but it’s missing that thing that the writer gives of themselves - a soul, if you will. 

Yesterday, I found myself in the zone at last. I had a great day - complete focus and clarity, even something approximating joy. I credit this to an immersive journaling app I’ve been using which gets you to self-reflect through an interactive fantasy story with atmospheric soundscapes. 

It’s been unexpectedly powerful for me and I think that’s because I get so immersed in its world, I’m more able to loosen up, suspend disbelief and shut up my inner critic. I’ve been doing a lot of self-introspection in this state of temporary escape and I find that it’s helped me not only touch base with myself but also connect with my characters on a deeper level.

755,Schnitzelinski,Discussion,7,writing,1625576249,"Literary format for a Star Trek like novel For some time now I had the idea of writing a Star Trek-like science fiction story where the focus is on space exploration. The crew of a space ship is on a longer mission with seperate adventures that usually only fill one ""chapter"" and aren't always connected, just how the older Star Trek shows usually have one adventure in one episode without any connection to previous or following episodes. 

They shouldn't be totally disconnected. In the series there always has been a higher story arc that unfolds and while some episodes have separate adventures, some are more relevant to the ""superplot"" than others. 

Is there a way to do something similar in writing? My original idea was just writing it as chapters in a novel, but I'm curious to what other media exist that may fit better for what I was planning to do. For example the Perry Rhodan books (which I still haven't begun to read to my shame) were originally published as separate stories called ""cycles"" in a magazine/dime novel. They too had a higher plot similar to the Star Trek shows. Later they were published as novels with some passages slightly edited and shortened.

As a more modern form of this I was also thinking about a webnovel format. Or I'll ditch prose entirely and write a script for a TV series. I'm open to other types of narratives and media aswell. What are your ideas for a story like this?"

I have noticed that most times, when there's an antagonist or character that has bad traits or commits horrible actions lots of people just start hoping the character dies or suffers and often diregard the rest of their plot. I love gray or morally evil characters and often like delving into why they are like this and why they believe in those horrible values but I am worried that if I write something like this in a novel I will either get people who just want him to die and not care or think I am supporting those values for making a villain deep and trying to understand his values? 

My story's antagonist has a pretty tragic background that caused him to fall into fascist believes. Throughout the story he gets more fascist to the point where he succeeds with a coup and takes over a kingdom to basically commit a holocaust of magic users and bring what he believes is order and freedom to the kingdom. Obviously, committing genocide and being fascist is wrong but I don't want it to just be a silly caricature of that and instead want to have several viewpoints of his character where he slowly goes down the rabbit hole till he becomes the antagonist. He obviously would try to justify his actions to himself and I am worried people would just be ""nah fuck that, I don't care"" or actually be ""The writer is definitely a fascist"" so I am not sure how I should handle it.

Any tips for this? The basic story for the character would be that he lost his younger sister when they were children to magic users and obsessed with their favorite books, which were typical stories about chosen ones and heroes who save the world. He starts believing that he is one of those heroes and that just like them, he needs to take matters into his own hands and sacrifice his own morality and sanity to save the world from magic now that technology is blooming. Even though he would be trying to justify his actions and thoughts, most characters would see him as someone evil and I definitely would not be painting him in a good light since at the end he dies miserably (He is pretty much a fantasy Hitler, I know... So original)

I would appreciate any feedback on how to make this character interesting instead of just having someone who people just hate. I really like to delve deep into my characters' thoughts and inner conflicts so I worry this might extend to other characters who are good people but struggle with depression, OCD and other things that might turn people off from a fantasy story."

767,butterflyky,Advice,10,writing,1625569445,"how do i get out of my own head i’ve been writing for a very long time and probably have hundreds of unfinished books. the only ones i have gotten kind of far on, i’ve ended up deleting. 

i write on wattpad and it’s so hard to get any attention on there so when i do feel confident enough about a story to post it, no one ever sees it and i get self conscious and delete.

i write pretty well as far as grammar, punctuation and spelling etc. (not that you can tell from this post lol) but my problem is all of my plot ideas feel dumb or i realize they’ve been done before. that or i just can’t figure out how to start them or how to continue them.

i feel like i’m just putting so much pressure on myself and i’m too insecure about my writing, especially because i know my friends would never tell me if it’s bad so i don’t know if they actually like it or not. 

essentially my question is how can i make myself let loose and chill out long enough to put some real work into a story and possibly make something out of it? even if it’s short and it just gets a few likes on wattpad, i just want to finish one and be accomplished for once!! i’ve been writing for years and have nothing to show for it, it’s so discouraging. 

(please let me know if this post violates the rules, i read them and i’m pretty sure it’s okay)"

780,Respectful_Guy557, ,2,writing,1625558187,"Critique? Fiction on the Battle of Hill 60 (Gallipoli)  

I peered up at the midnight sky, to see the smile of the crescent moon shimmer upon me from a great distance, shrouded by abysmally soulless clouds. I drew in a sharp breath through my numbing nose, and the pungent smells of Gallipoli made their way through my nostrils. The grime, sweat and blood of countless soldiers who had toiled endlessly against the foreign shores of Turkey, but more consequently against their own minds, mingled with the fresh smell of the salty Aegean sea, was carried up by a cold breeze that was as unwelcome as the impending assault.              

The attack pervaded all of our fragile minds. I could hear it in the shuffle of the soldier next to me, and feel it in the cold breaths I blew out softly, maintaining a constant rhythm that was my personal clock, counting down to a rapidly approaching death. One whistle would have me running towards uneasy guns on undecided legs. One whistle would have forty thousand men run pitifully towards their mortality’s resolution and their eternality’s resurrection. 

We would be gone, lost, and eventually forgotten.  Perhaps we would be revered for a time, we might have a grave, or a memorial, or possibly even a day of remembrance. But all we wanted was to feel again. To feel something that wasn’t so cold, be it our mothers’ warmth or the inscrutable hellfire we would be subjected to at the end of this fool’s parade. All I could wish for was to join the stars above me. They teased me with their ebullient tinkles - a welcome distraction from the brewing storm; the looming whistle. 

I was gazing at the midnight sky like a baby first setting it’s eyes on the world when the whistle caught me by surprise. The sound cut through the filthy air, making me cringe; it felt as though a ferocious knife had lacerated straight at my ears, which rang painfully. Usually, the sound wouldn’t have been so discomposing, but after the stillness of the night the keenness of the sound made it feel as though the cogs of the world were starting to rotate once more, after a long rest. My constant apprehension of it had led me to a grim toleration of it as it reverberated harshly within me, clanging within my very soul. My heart was up my throat, and my body was constricting, as if the thick air had started to compress me. But I had memorised the task at hand so well that it served as an escape from my harsh reality. I was completing a list of chores in quick succession, with the grace one can only gain from acceptance. 

Suddenly, I was up on the ground, leaving the trenches behind me. Men were falling in front, and men were falling behind. It was almost as if the Earth was sinking with every body that struck the ground. But my mind was sinking even further. Every *rat tat tat tat* of the machine guns ahead seemed to eat away at my soul. More than once as my feet thudded repetitively against the blood stroken dirt, do I remember almost *wishing* that a bullet struck me. 

I saw something shift in the land ahead of me; a small movement in my peripheral vision. As I neared the source of the movement; a small ditch hidden behind a bush, I pretended to fall, as if struck by a deliberate bullet. I started shuffling forwards whilst prone. And then I saw it. It was the sweaty forehead of a Turk, who had dug himself behind foliage, sniping random men who charged forwards, and playing dead when they came past. My heart in my throat, I grabbed my gun, aiming at the tip of the soldier's head. There was no time for sentimentality here; it was the soldier’s hour. I pulled the trigger in a superficial moment of resolution and temporary mental iron. But as soon as I saw the metal become red again in his brow, I realised what I had been sheltered from throughout this war. We were all spitting at the wind, whilst not realising we were nothing but dust in the breeze, spitting against the wind just for it to come back to us in our insignificance. I froze for a moment, and then slowly got up, dropping my gun.

I started running as I had never run. At that moment, I was running against the very world. I was a speck in the universe, a spot of ink in the fables of time, and I had just realised how insignificant I was, but for some uncanny reason this made me feel *vast*. The world was me; it depended on me. I was miles ahead of everyone else both physically and mentally. I think the fact that I was finally free from soldiering made me the most exceptional soldier on the field at that moment. But I was far from being free, and a bullet struck me in my leg and the slowly expanding bubble of existentialism I had been developing popped spontaneously. I stopped almost comically, falling face first into the dirt. But what had been more affected was my soul. A bullet that had grazed the side of my thigh had completely halted me. I had been so satisfied for a moment, and even to this day I long for that experience. A single bullet had destroyed that beauty. 

That was when I finally understood death, and this realization was what drew me back to reality completely. I shedded away the brief glimpses of insanity - no, it wasn’t insanity, I think it was a philosophical cognizance - and resentfully embraced my cold reality. I layed on the ground pitfully, my tears uncomfortably snaking down the sides of my face, dripping down to the pool of blood that stuck to my hair annoyingly. I tasted a tear, the grime of my face and the salt of the tear enveloping taste buds. My wound smarted with no distinguishable pattern, painfully stinging randomly. 

I got up as steadily as I could manage, hesitantly limping forwards towards the onslaught of bullets. I must have looked ridiculous, limping through the tumultuous battlefield, holding my rifle at my side freely. After the battle I recall many soldier’s whispering about the lone limper, bravely making head-way to the Turks without a second thought. 

But I was anything but brave. Many say there is a thin line between bravery and stupidity, but there is an ever smaller boundary between the brave and the apathetic. The battlefield was a sight of pandemonium and chaos. I took a deep breath of the war-torn air, and the smells of Gallipoli should have been more pungent than in the trenches, but my pain overrode that smell; my wound was stinging harshly and more frequently. But I didn’t care anymore. Every bullet that drove furiously past me, zipping silently through the air like a minacious missile was a reminder of the depravity of men in desperation, but more so in their opulence. I had realised the smaller aspects of what was happening in this battle, but now, far from the battle and in the comfort of my hearth I can perceive the bigger picture. 

The individual’s battle in war is not of strength or shooting skill. The individual’s battle is one of the mind; in keeping their heart afire and swimming above a cavernous ocean fuelled by their mortality. If they sink into this inscrutable void of lack of mental fortitude, they will suffer a despondency that is commonly disregarded as the mysterious melancholy of war. But in contrast, it is in reality a hopelessness that can be suffered by a man of immense quietude as well as a man riding the wrath of war alike. I call it despondency for lack of a more specific term. The vagueness of the word does not do the experience itself right. Nothing, I think, can really explain the emotion of hopelessness except experiencing it.

My fragile breaths, which quivering ominously, were inhaled and exhaled synchronously with my worn-down legs. The pacing of war is a unique thing; constantly fluctuating in unison with your mental state; one moment you may be fearing a bullet striking you down, and the next you may be accustomed to your situation. But never relaxed. I had been limping for so long, looking at my feet like a shamed child, that I had not realised the machine guns had ceased and that an onslaught of Turks were rising from their trenches like a raven from it’s sombre slumber. 

They were starting to charge at us in a last-ditch, suicidal attempt to hold their position. And that was when I realised we actually were winning. I waited, trying to feel some sort of happiness in my stomach before they reached us. I felt around my mind, trying to grasp some sense of victory - anything to replace my hollowness. There was none. There was no victory. 

Victory is the most artificial aspect of war. No individual wins except the ones that were never at the battle itself. What was a victory in which your loss was so great you would never be able to have another one? Was that really worth it? But I had decided then that I wouldn’t worry about this, and would try to forget. But even after all these years my mind won’t accept that one victory. Why can’t my mind at least feign happiness? 

The Turks were closing in, and what was I to do? Sweat trickled down my grimy forehead, dripping slowly down onto the coarse dirt beneath my aching feet. I looked up, closing my eyes, feeling the wind brushing against my neck, fiddling shyly with my hair. It started to rain melodiously, trickling down with my sweat. That was the only time I smiled in that battle. And there I stood, a lone figure with a limp in the mist, head tilted backwards, tasting the thick rain with the tip of my tongue, a sorrowful smile on my dejected face. For a second; a wonderful moment, I was *not*. I simply *wasn’t*. I had been taken from the world slowly, like the slow caress of a mother as she lovingly takes her child. I think, truly, that is what death feels like. 

I’m told I stood there for a long time, and by some heavenly miracle, or from sympathy from the Turks, I was spared. Whether it was the mists of vague compassion or thick, sweet rain I do not know; but is there really any difference? The battle ended as abruptly as it had started. We didn’t know whether we had won, until we were told by the melancholic lips of officers on the boats off Gallipoli. When the screams had died down, I knelt, and saw a parting in the mists ahead of me. The sun was rising gloriously, bathing us all in heavenly sunshine, our sodden uniforms glowing gold as the rivers of blood glittered maroon, dead masks plastered onto countless bodies. The fog glowed yellow with the summer sunshine, a vibrant, yet elegant, facade on the blood stained battlefield. I knelt beside a Turk’s corpse. Instead of staring at the sun, I looked down at his face.

He was alive, at the brink of mortality. He stared *into* me, his gaze wandering into the crevices of my soul, which had been splintered into a dozing branching ravines, not unlike the continuous, perpetual flow of blood on the hill, travelling down into the Earth below, returning once more as eternity received its homage. I grabbed his hand, and surprisingly, it felt soft, like the warm kiss of the sun on my face. The pain had faded, but the sadness didn’t. It was only amplified as the Turk left, and I could feel him beside me, staring at his corpse dolefully. We both stayed there for a while; me kneeling, subconscious tears trickling down my nose, clearing the grime and blood to create pathways of temporal cleanliness. Eventually, he started shuffling, and faded away into the dispersing mists like the fragile departure of an autumn leaf as the Earth gradually sheds life and embraces the cold bite of winter. I let go of the hand, which had become frigid and inhospitable, and it fell to the ground with a dull *thump*. 

I am at my desk, twenty years later, with a family and a house. I should be at peace, and sometimes, when I am watching my children or sitting with my family on our porch, I think I truly am. But mostly, I am still trapped in that war. The mists; the tears; that Turk’s haunted eyes; the ghost of the man I killed as a boy - I am defined by all of these. My children often ask why I stare into the stars so often, and I always answer with the same response: 

“I am not staring at the stars. They are staring at me.”"
781,Boaredyy,Discussion,4,writing,1625557074,"How much space in a novel should be allotted for a subplot? In my case, it's a friendship-&gt;romantic subplot. My work is a multi pov of 3 and it rotates to each of them in order per chapter. I am currently on a chapter that focuses on a pair of budding relationship; this takes a whole chapter of 5,000 words (an average length in regards to the novel I'm writing). Although it has relevance to the main plot, this is definitely a subplot. I feel like i am justified in doing this as their relationship would be used against him as a threat which would result in a coma of the romantic interest and would affect his would view and motivations afterwards; however, I do feel biased about this as I liked what I have written (and partly due to laziness as I know i will have to restructure all pov's just so I don't have downtime for this)

So my question is: how much space should be allotted to the subplot, if it's even allowed to dominate the narrative even for a short time at all, and are there guidelines to follow in integrating a subplot to the main plot."

784,1984ByGeorgeOrwell,Discussion,0,writing,1625554512,"Hi, I’d like some critique on this piece. I’m working on a set called The Stories of Bloodborne II. This particular one is called ‘Panopticon’. The wall of eyes was massive. It loomed high in the air, its scale such that it appeared to curve so that it may be accommodated by a far more logical ceiling. The eyes themselves were massive still, their irises producing a veritable forest of undulating color. In the darkness, each pupil had dilated in a desperate attempt to make use of the single flickering candle in the center of the room.


Their attempts were in vain. The miasma of noncolor that persisted throughout the near-silent chamber was pervasive. The candle was little more than an ornament, fastened to the end of a limb. 


Two far smaller eyes stared back at the wall with intent, irises darkened by pupils reminiscent of dead starlight. 


Master Duncan set his candle down on a nearby table, easing the wax into rotting wood, before pulling a number of other candles from his deep coat. He lit them in succession and placed them with a sharp deliberateness, in such a fashion that their light licked uncomfortably at the edges of the wall. The eyes within began to twitch, screaming for an illumination so close to the horizon as to be tangible. They blinked aggressively. There was a subtle tinkling from above, a chorus of small bells, which was soon supplemented by the rain-symphony of blood, dripping from wounds that had been inflicted in the lids of each eye. Wicked hooks driven through the upper hood, bleeding gashes made fresh by another attempt at sight. With each blink, a cord was tensed, a bell rang, blood running all the while. 


Duncan retreated to the very center of the room, where the blood had pooled, mixing with great globules of tears to produce a silky medium, murky, but reflective. It was scooped into a large basin, already nearly full of the solution, uncoagulated, brutally raw, as pain often was. 


In a corner of the room there was a phonograph and a selection of wax cylinders, each carrying their own melody. Duncan disregarded the various samples of music and removed from his coat his own cylinder, tinged pink. Rather than being adorned with a number of ordered nubs, it was misshapen, writhing and receding, it seemed, at a whim. Entire sections were horribly bloated. 


Duncan slotted the object into the phonograph. It clicked into place, and, as if in obligation, the mechanism sprung to life smoothly. 


A horrid wail filled the chamber, a performative orchestra of inhuman ache, accompanied by groans incomprehensible. In the background was a rhythmic ticking, which never deviated from its simple march. *Tick. Tick. Tick.*


The eyes, initially in a frenzy, fell into time, blinking a sanguine symphony, and the bells overhead did the same, their resonance painting a series of coincident ripples within the depths of Duncan’s basin. 


Duncan himself was far in the rear, his hands bowed over his head, dancing a delicate strut, his vision empty. Him and the darkness and the eyes that were not his danced to the sounds of pain until the groans and wails ceased, leaving only the *tick tick tick*ing in their place. Duncan delicately stepped to the basin, engaging in a steep bow, submerging himself in his medium. His face and hair came up slathered in crimson, as the screams resumed, and he returned to his stage for an epilogue. 


He stepped in time, whirling slowly about the chamber, his audience and orchestra moving with him. Every few steps, the chorus was taken by a toll impossibly large, and he convulsed, doubling up and shivering. With each step, his opera grew louder, the light of his candles bringing him into sharp relief, as their flames too exploded into a new life. 


A wall and two of pupils dilated in unison. 


Duncan brought his arms to rest in a circle around his face, which was ringed in red shadow. He giggled, his voice breathy against the once-again silence. 


“I can see… *everything*.”


He collapsed in the center of his sea of blood and tears, dead."

My story (SciFi themed) mainly focused on a smuggler character and his robot sidekick with the backdrop of a galaxy at war. I've used my first chapter though to introduce a few characters from the military, to do some brief intros on who the good guys and bad guys are (to put it bluntly) and the war, as well as mention/tease the antagonist.

Thing is, now that's done I didn't plan on returning to that character until much later on.

I keep hearing about likability, and my wife gave me feedback on one of my characters not being likable. So, the thing with that example  is that it's a horror novella and this MC isn't going to make it out OK, so I wanted to make sure that people kind of like seeing a ""asshole who portrays himself as a lovable asshole get his karmic justice"" with a POV turn-around for the very last chapter.   


Is this... a flawed concept from the beginning? I, personally, have grown EXTREMELY bored with (super?) hero arcs and ""good guys vs bad guys"" so I'm having trouble reconciling this advice with my attitude. Am I simply approaching this from too negative of a place?   


For context, I'd say Game of Thrones morality is my favorite kind, but I also find the Starks (The archetypical ""good"" guys) to be the most boring characters and primarily saw them as a foil for the morally grey ""real"" MCs, Littlefinger, Varys, Tyrion, Dany, etc.

First Chapter

\-The Past - Mark-

He’s been dead for several days now. And non-existence, to him, was getting boring. He slowly became aware, and, out of the darkness, he came, standing in the snow for the second time in existence; he was being—no memory of past, future; events, just a little deja-vu here and there. Taking a breath of fresh air, he breathes in and out. ""Cold,"" he says, as he shivered, thinking nothing in particular and merely existing; unknowing of life beyond and before…

Walking home, he noticed something aside from his general reality. Something strange at first sight, like a piece of land in the sky, shining brightly against the sun’s light, it looked so real, but to think, in memory, it was just the clouds in the sky, and as he looked and stared even more so, the land in the sky turned to clouds of a shifting nature.

Here he is, 8-years old, and on his way home to a meager little house in a small town somewhere out in Canada. A boy, he was. Young, and old. His name, Mark Young.

He went towards his house, and as he slowly reached the steps, he went up; step by step and went into the house’s shed part. He blew out a cold breath of fresh air as he entered the front door. He took off his coat and shoes. And then took another breath and headed off into the living room. And there he saw his Capan, an Elder, sitting on the couch watching an old show that he didn’t quite know the name of. Probably I love Lucy or something silly like that. He sat on the sofa near to her, but on the end, like a curious little monkey. He looked at her with a warm look about him, then to the TV; he looked; wondering what the show was all about. It was most certainly that I love Lucy show.

Soon he fell asleep to the show. He loved Lucy, but he was tired. He woke to the tiring feeling of being alive. He rolled over to see the couch before him as well as his arms in front of him, tired, he lay still, attempting to sleep.

He wakes, and it’s the morning. Nothing was more lovely than the sunlight against the curtain in the kitchen. He came to his senses as he took on the day from this moment forward, he left the living room to meet his Kokom.

His Kokom, cooking some eggs in the pan, he hears the sizzle of bacon in another. As he stands to a halt, and on his side was something odd and familiar. Odd to be out in such a peculiar environment. Although it wasn’t that odd, I guess, but it was most certainly familiar, as it was a ball; it was red, blue, and white. He picked it up and gave it a good toss, being bored and all. As he made his way to the through the small slightly large house, aware, he yawned and tried to grab a plate as his Kokom made a gesture to the sink. And as he scrummages through the dishes and the dishwater to find one; he does, he then dried a plate with a cloth, as he firmly placed it on the countertop, hoping to have a good meal.

Eating, he took a slice of bacon into his mouth and gobbled it up like it was pastrami as he cut around the yolk in the eggs while taking a piece just as quickly as he gobbled up the bacon. And while the bacon hung in his mouth, he savoured the taste of the soft mushy egg yolk.

And, without a doubt, that was the most fantastic meal he's ever had. He heads outside, and it’s warm and cold as the day foretold. With a hot shining sun in the midst of this snowy white day.

Step by step, he went on about his way throughout the world within reality and claimed dominance amongst his peers, but little did he know; he had no peers. So, he claimed it later…

Whilst in the kingdom of God; God knew naught about this being in existence. This being, known as Mark.

And, underway, Mark was planning a future of true sublime intelligence, and with no one watching him, or so he thought; he went on about his way throughout his life in reality with unknown beings of Space or Earth; watching him.

And on a day as wondrous as this, he fought his way through the battling paths of 'today' and 'tomorrow,' while 'yesterday,' and the days before were a complex battle to all 'knowing' beings.

And that; there; is simply the lower case. As 'KNOWing' was a much more complex analytic in life. As that is God's 'KNOWing.'

Anyway, on Mark's day of revolution, he spent countless hours doing nothing in particular with the life that he was, being…

Snowy terrain amongst the surrounding area of his very, well, being. The rough ragged ground around his shoes was slippery; but grippy, because the ground was littered with gravel for grip amongst vehicles around sharp turns as well as at the stops in the locale as this town had no stop signs to boot.

And, as he followed a path of great adventure, he found there could be no better place than going down to the frozen lake of Canoe Narrows. The one and only place where he could be alone, to think, no doubt. As he loved the cool crisp air of Winter, and the lake was quite possibly the coolest place you could be.

And as he headed towards the hill, down he went, where the lake lay, as there was a bed of ice seen upon it; slowly but surely he made it to his near destination, as the lake was, simply put, near his house, and as he spent his time looking towards the other end of the lake, he figured he could cross it, but, a long journey to the other end it would be. The thought may have crossed his mind more than once in his life, future and past, but, to no avail; he never crossed such a path.

The view was grand; he was intrigued, only because he was so fascinated with the life around him that he had had no choice but to notice the simplicity as well as the complexity of life with his being of mind, knowing, he stepped onto the rigged ice and stood as if he were Jesus Christ or something.

Upon the ice, he left the studded ground of rocks by the shoreline, and took a few more steps toward the inner circle of the lake. Taking a breather, he said, ""what a nice view,"" And, taking another breather, he found the tree line in the passing distance, unknowing of the life upon it.

He noticed the tire tracks around him without noticing, and without knowing, he found that there were 'few vehicles' in this meager little town and found there to be less upon the ice for 'that' reason. And without reason, he went back up the hill and back to his humble abode as he spent countless hours down by the lake; Winter, rain or shine.

And, on his way up the hill; he saw wild-life within the space of the open sky and noted the dearly beloved; Eagle, without knowledge of its being. He simply noticed the thing floating above his closed off little mind, unknowing of what it was… And yet, he said to himself, ""an Eagle!"" Shielding his eyes from the bright sun; light, unsure if it truly was. Later, telling his Kokom of the viewing of this wild life in the sky.

Closer and closer he got to the top of the hill to take in the sight of very few houses within eyes reach, he took in the view of his parents house, being in his living range upon the land they were gifted by the white people as a sign of peace or something of the sort. As the peace treaties took place before his time. And so, The First Nation people made amends with The White Man to share the land, and later to free the slaves as they took in their people for reasons unknown to The First Nation people.

Life on this planet was complex in nature. As life was still learning what we already know. Knowing, 'we found that life can be peaceful and always could be,' yet, life was of a complex nature, as was once said, although this meaning could be the life of this planet, he had yet to 'know…'

All the while, he had made it back to his truly superb old home; of a house, thinking of his next great adventure for the day had not ended. It was the year 1996, and his time was magnificent. A time of true greatness emerged within his life of true boredom. His life; to him, was boring, and so he thought of a great many things in his life that made him wonder and ponder the thought of life upon his planet. Knowing in some way…

Standing in the snow, he said, “I’ll never smoke,” as he took a breather, he looked down in noticement of the cool loving ground of Mother-Earth, and took a few more steps, going nowhere and noplace within the depths of his mind, the space of his thoughts, unknowing…

1) “He was an old fashioned teacher. He started every class talking about how he used to be able to swat misbehaving children, which is never what you want to hear when you get to school. That’s like going to a doctor and being told, ‘I used to be able to saw your leg off if you stubbed your toe, but times change don’t they.’”

2) “He looked like the love child of Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, which is very ironic if you know history.”

I was wondering if you all had any tips to keep for me to keep mind to make sure the protagonist remains likeable. 

For the record, I'm more or less keeping to what we empirically know to be true about how and why real-life people become terrorists.  So (un)fortunately I'm staying away from trite (but powerful emotional) reasons -- family member/love interest dying -- and sticking to more mundane (but true to the literature) reasons such as feelings of political and personal powerlessness, a lack of confidence in institutional pathways for political change, and elite-led inspiration (in this case my protag is infected with a sentient alien virus that turns him into a super-powered individual -- it is a sci-fi story, after all).

Here's a little (low effort) example:                                                                                                                                                      ""I opened the door to my room and threw myself on the bed. Then I remembered, my father has guests over.""

https://jordanbpeterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Essay_Writing_Guide.docx

Hello everyone, I’ve been reading Jordan Peterson’s guide to writing and the importance of being articulate and I am very motivated to start writing everyday.

I’m a university student and I read and write in English a lot. I listen to many podcasts all in English. But my first language is Arabic 

I think in English, so I feel like it would be a much easier endeavor to start writing in English and I believe I would enjoy it as well. However, my goal is to be articulate in Arabic for my future career.

I’m as articulate in Arabic as anyone I know in my community but Arabic has many different dialects so the way I speak cannot be written. Books are limited in Arabic so if I were interested in a specific topic for writing it might not be easy to find things to read about that topic.

For this I think it would be easier to start writing in English but I’m curious to know if that will impact my articulation in Arabic as well. Being articulate in English is also very important to me but not as important as being articulate in Arabic at this point in my life so does being articulate in English make me articulate in Arabic as well?"

A name for a guard or military unit consisting of former smugglers and thieves. The hero/main character prevents the execution of the later leaders of the troop. With the help of a move-in order of all small criminals. The captain of the city guard wanted to hang them anyway. Thanks to the military orders that the main character has and is about the time that he can turn into a dragon. He is currently the only one of whom we know who has been given this ability. Of 170 years, the last to receive this gift were killed in a war. Nevertheless, the associated unit still has power and watch. The crooks therefore decide on Old books and laws to re-establish this guard. The guards are rather dressed in dark colors and are also too bad for a not so direct fight thanks to their past. But also fight openly, mainly with weapons of thieves, one-handed swords, axes/throwing axes, throwing knives and longbows.

Since the criminals should actually come together with the other small criminals according to military code so and so in a penal army. No hardcore criminal, or did you want to go around the country together with a nearly 60-strong troop of murderers psychopaths and rapists on orders, train them, take care of them and have only four infantrymen, two scouts, two archers and two other friends at your disposal.

You are also welcome to try any suitable animal names that indicate a special behavior of the group. Like the howlers from Red Rising Book by Pierce Brown

and if you feel like it, you can also come up with a little background story. Why the captain of the guard wants to hang them even though there is only prison for the crimes that people started. The city is called Schwarz-Furt.

## EXCERPT:

**Chapter 2: The crew**

   

We were drifting at the edge of a planetary system we had just jumped into. I was mostly surrounded by empty space, with a couple of meteoroids of varied sizes floating here and there. I could barely see the star and the planets from the distance we were at, zooming in with my telescope would’ve helped with that, but I didn’t see the need for it. 

My crewmembers were still in their rectangular-shaped hibernation stations, almost completely powered down, all of them were minutes from waking up.

Lester Pierce, our Captain, was the sentioid in the hibernation station at the very right, he was one that did his job very well, always followed protocol, and never let any of his emotions make decisions for him. He was, however, always quite easy to persuade, as long as the protocol wasn’t neglected. He had been our captain for about four thousand years.

Next to him we had Erma van Hout, our Commander. Family oriented and a bit too nice if you ask me, I sometimes wondered if she had ever come across any hurdles in her life, because of the massive amounts of positivity she exuded. However, I had seen her throw a tantrum before, so I’d always watch out and tried not to get on her bad side. Next to being overly nice, she was also quite brave, a combination that was pretty rare to see. She had been with us for about five hundred years.

In the station next to Erma’s was Lieutenant Nate Kendrick, he was the one I knew the longest, and was part of the first crew to ever board on my vessel. Fierce, brutal, and confident to the point of arrogance. A very peculiar personality, that one. He was the one I technically should’ve trusted the most, because we’d known each other since the very beginning, but I didn’t, oddly enough. He was someone that gave me bad vibes, it had been that way since the moment he stepped foot on my vessel and called me bulky. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t the only one that felt that way about him.

Next to Kendrick’s station, was Wendy Dodge, our mechanic, she was the one responsible for anything that needed fixing. She was relatively new to the crew, about two hundred years. She had some very weird taste in music in my opinion, she once played a song about setting the world on fire. *But* she had a great sense of humor, so I guess that evened it out. She has a certain type of masculinity to her, and I always found it kind of attractive.

The last one in the hibernation stations was Bobby Brooklyn. He was the recruit, our newest member, and it was his first mission with us. I didn’t know much about him, except that he was the last one of us to get glitzed, think it was six years ago. He didn’t even introduce himself when he came onto the ship; just went straight towards the stations, anchored himself onto one, and powered down.

And of course, there was Vanessa Hibbs, that’s me! I’ve already said almost everything about myself, except that I had the best personality out of the whole crew, according to myself. My ship’s code was IMS-27506, the IMS stood for interstellar mining ship, very creative. The ship itself was made out of cargon, a nearly impenetrable substance. It was painted white of color, had a matte finish, and to quote the lieutenant, I was admittingly bulky, but that was because I had to carry a lot of negatanium."

However, I feel my basic premise isn't good enough. One of the things I like to do is character design, but I also like giving personality and scenarios for my characters to experience to give them life. About 2 years ago, I had this idea for 3 specific characters that I just had to write down. I also already knew from then on that they it would suit them to be part of an episodic 11-minutes-a-piece type series. The basic premise is that these 3 best friends go on wild adventures from the simple slice-of-life kind to the completely fantastical while problem-solving and growing as people along the way. If there was to be any kind of linear plotline, it would be something that wouldn't appear until later on and merely ""hinted at"" in the earlier episodes. Other than that, it's pure simple dream (and sometimes nightmare) fuel. They gotta save the city's kids from being mind-controlled by a video game, they get lost in an abandoned mine only to find incredible stuff they've never seen before, and they even go on a hilarious quest to find out what the unexplored areas of the ocean are hiding. At the same time, there are more down-to-earth stories like a character trying to understand chess, the friends' sour attempts at trying to sell chestnuts for a fundraiser, etc. The problem is, I like this a lot, but I don't think it will ever work because this stuff has been done a million times already, and there's nothing new I can add to the table.

The premise is the ""evil"" team are actually the ""good"" guys, and the scientist who sent you out on your journey is actually the bad guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Summary: 

&amp;#x200B;

Bad ending 

&amp;#x200B;

The player goes out on a creature collection journey, like with Pokemon, but every time they get into a battle, they risk seriously injuring the people and monsters they're fighting against. The game keeps track of this (or at least I plan for it to). After a certain amount of key players are injured/killed off in-game, a shadow creature appears that can grant the player's character invincibility and strengthen their attacks. The cost however, in-game is the character's sanity.  In a Tell-Tale Heart fashion, the character becomes more violent and blood-thirsty and guilty, until the game ends with the character's death. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good ending: 

&amp;#x200B;

The player goes out on a creature collection journey, like with Pokemon, but they soon learn that what they were told at the beginning of the game was a lie and that they're actually abusing the creatures by trying to tame them. Distraught and angry, the character joins a rebellion organized by former members of the ""evil"" team and spend their time rescuing the creatures and finally confronting the scientist.

So I was just wondering, for people who are good at it. How did you get started, and how did you improve? And is there some book/material with ideas on how to come up with metaphors? 

Most articles I have found focus on how essential metaphors are and give many examples of good metaphors. But I cannot just reuse many of them because my work tends to be in a highly specialized field."

Anyone else struggle with this? I didn't do loads and loads of planning before I started writing as I had the story very clear in my head and just need to get it down, and knew that if I laboured over every detail in the planning stages I'd never actually write the thing...."

It's a post apocalyptic story that was sort of a waking dream.

But here's the thing. 

Post apocalyptic fiction seems to have been overcooked and done to death in the popular media (The Hunger Games et al) and it's loaded with triteness and tropes. I can't submit anything THAT trite.

So help me out. Name me ALL the trite tropes in post apocalyptic fiction so I can make them go away and turn in a workmanlike product."

A world in which love was never lost. How could it be? It’d have to be found in the first place.
I grow weary of my thoughts. How many years have I spent, sitting with them? Letting their taste linger for far too long. Breaking them apart, shuffling words here and there, then reforming the whole, recreating the same thing. Not the same. Just similar. A likeness, yet nothing was gained in the creation of these crude facsimiles. Although similar, they’re not the same, so it seems something must have been lost. I’ve allowed myself to wither. I didn’t know it was something I could prevent. I didn’t know there was a threat to watch out for. 
I flicked through the channels. Something new came on, faces I’d seen all too much, donning new apparel, which is why I believed them to be novel. Maybe they were novel nonetheless. How many things can be made from just one?
I flicked again and saw trees. Again, and saw trees burning. Again, and the trees became saplings, adorning a large field, plain to look at but so clearly pregnant with potential. In mere seconds I saw the Phoenix live, burn, and rise from those ages. Not those ashes. Similar ones. I saw no Phoenix. The Phoenix lives in my mind, and will die here too. All that existed were pictures on a panel, come and gone with the pressure passed on by a truly distant finger. It’s almost amazing how fake and departed everything has become in our strive to make it more real and persistent. Yet we persist.


I have no idea what I even would want this to be if I ever wrote more, it kinda poured out. I feel lighter, from relief, and a bit empty right now. Honestly this feels kinda special to me, I think cause it hits a lot of personal notes. So I’m posting here to see if that beauty exists only in my mind. Which it probably does now I’m looking back at this lol.

Something I thought you all would be interested in:

I just got my advanced copy of Natalie Goldberg’s new deck (Writing Down the Bones Deck), and though I haven’t delved too deep into it, it seems like a really great resource so far. 60 cards with a prompt on the front and some commentary/teachings from Natalie on the back. 

It should pub soon, I think, so I just wanted to give it a little advanced praise! Definitely useful for those of you who feel stuck or enjoy a little push from a randomly-pulled prompt. Or for those of you who genuinely feel Natalie’s book has been helpful to you in the past and are looking for more of her words and motivation. I know I’ve read threads on here discussing her work, so I figured there might be some interest (I personally haven’t really seen it marketed anywhere, so I’m not sure if a ton of people are aware of it).

Everytime i take a glimpse at a unique sunset a thought crosses my mind... 
I wish i could take a photo with my eyes, but not like the photo. We have phones and at every moment we can take the picture of the sunset but the thing is that the photo doesn't capture the whole emotion that the sunset brings to our hearts. I wish i could capture the emotions that the sunsets bring to us. 
Sometimes it makes me sad that i dont remember every sunset i have seen with my eyes, i know i have been impressed and left speechless by a lot of them but i wont remember most of them in the future. Thats the beauty of moments. I was looking at the sunset today. The sky filled with white, dark blue and orangy tones. I was left so sad because even though i enjoyed the moment i knew it was going to end, and probably i wont remember those exact emotions that the sunset brought me. I feel like happy memories are the same. We often feel sad about the happy moment ending before it even ends. I think the part of us being sad about that has to do with not knowing how the future is going to go. 
Back to sunsets. 
Sunsets are like people. Taking the photo of a sunset doesn't capture its whole beauty and emotion. A photo doesn't show the little white stroke in the sky that is barely visible which makes u feel hope. Sunsets are like people. Often beautiful people dont look that beautiful on photo. Its not because they aren't beautiful.its because the artificial camera can not capture the sparkle in their eyes or the energy they fill the whole room with. Beautiful people are like sunsets. 
Beautiful at first glance and even more beautiful when u start to look up close.”

Asking for a story I'm writing. I'm about two thirds the way into the story, and have this weird thing going on with Victor Frankenstein. Anyway, way before the story takes place, he went to college in 1875 with Dracula. But since the book Frankenstein came out in 1818 (which I already knew way before writing the story, so I dunno why I did this) I don't know what to do. Should I use the inconsistency to my advantage to make Victor look a lot weirder and mysterious, or should I go back and change all the references to the time period and story details, like ages and some actions?

It's a Wattpad story, but it doesn't have many reads, so I'm wondering if people would notice, but I know one person might notice if story details change as they're reading. What should I do? l've been asking others."

Heat

He laid on the shower floor, ripping hot water hitting his back

He was just laying there... listening 

Listening to the sounds of Frank Ocean's voice, the sounds of Kid Cudi's hums

Listening for the sound of a buzz.

He had been there for only 23 minutes but to him it felt like an eternity.

He kept thinking he heard it... the familiar sound he heard thousands of times a day. But this time was different, usually he waited patiently but now he waits anxiously. Usually he is fine with the waiting but this time it was agonizing.

\*vrrrzz\*

That was it

He shot up off the floor and turned the water off, he dried his hands off quickly and rushed to the sink where his phone laid. He paused the music and saw the notification ""Damn"" he said ""ESPN"". He unpaused the music and as the chorus of Pursuit of Happiness played, he returned to the shower floor and the hot water continued to hit him.

The Girl is in his Dreams

As he laid on the floor he thought about the recurring dream he has had every night for the past week. It always opens up with him sitting on the couch in a familiar living room. He would just sit and wait much like he's doing now. He could tell the living room was his grandparents house, but the house was empty. Nobody was there except for him and his thoughts.  He heard a knock at the door.

He stood up to open it and just as he did she walked right in. 

He couldn't see her face but he knew it was her.

She leaped into his arms and gave him a huge hug.

She sat down on the sofa and they started to talk.

But as soon as she says the words ""Can I ask you something?"" He wakes up. 

He always tries desperately to go back to sleep, to go back to that moment that lives only in his brain. But he is left without closure, he never knows how it ends.

\*vrrrzz\*

There it is again

He goes through the same routine 

Jump out of the shower

Turn off the water

Wipe off your hands

Pause your music

Look at the notification 

He reads the notification 

""Snapchat""

He opens it

""It's a voice message""

He plays it

The sound of her voice gives him butterflies 

He wants to be with her so desperately 

He can't stand this feeling anymore 

But then he thinks about her boyfriend 

He thinks about how he would feel if he was getting cheated on

So he types out a half assed response and returns to the shower floor

The sounds of Masego and Don Toliver's Mystery Lady ring throughout the room

He had never related to a song more.

He knows exactly what the artists feel

He needs to kill these feelings.

He gets out of the shower and grabs his phone. He opens messages and taps on the most familiar conversation he has ever had. The name is simply ""🔌🍃"" 

He types out ""Yo can I get an eighth?""

He gets the response ""I'll be there in 15""

When the person gets there he hands him $35 and gets a bag of weed in return.

He walks up the stairs and shuffles to find his papers and his lighter. He pulls out a paper, scrunches it up, smooths it out, creases it and rolls a joint. He smokes it until there is nothing left, he burns his thumb and lips smoking the roach and then repeats it.

He couldn't feel his face anymore, and he definitely couldn't feel the despair he was feeling earlier.

He knew this wouldn't fix his feeling completely but it was like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. It made him feel better so he still did it. 

He opened Snapchat on his phone

He knew there weren't any new messages, he just wanted to hear her voice again.

He scrolled through old messages for hours just listening to the old conversations they would have. 

He thought to himself ""there is no way he makes her as happy as I could"" dangerous thoughts.

He felt like he had her boyfriend's heart in the palm of his hand, it was like he could hear the sounds of their love and he hated it. He couldn't believe he let her slip away. 

She was the love of his life, he knew she was perfect for him, and that he was perfect for her. 

But still, he didn't ask her out when he could have.

He wanted to act on his feelings sooner, but he couldn't tell when the right moment was, and now it's glaringly obvious to him that because he waited too long, she stopped waiting for him."

You try to move but the body is froze like stone, trapped you look around more and more to find where you really are. Out of sight you see something with only sound. You feel it’s there but can’t see it. Suddenly you open your eyes and are awake, you move to the side of the bed and feeling the beating of your own chest as it pulses. The blood flow racing through your veins. You think it was just a dream and close your eyes again. Sadly you don’t know your still dreaming. As you awake in the now “dream” your greeted by the same stone like body, the same frozen shell. With eyes only able to gaze the room. But you see the presents this time. It’s not able to be described with words because we don’t have things complex enough to do it justice. To describe to fear it possesses is insurmountable. But it’s there, you wake up again or so you think in the dream realm. But it’s dark out and thinking it’s time to eat you make your way to the door. You open it and move your right hand to flip the light. But after doing so it’s still dark. You see the light is on but the black still surrounds you. Racing to the next switch you are pulled back into the room with a scream so high it pierces your soul, you shut your eyes..... and it all stops, your back in the bed but this time there is light outside. You get up and walk to the door seeing it’s still shut you open it and walk out, but not a single sound come from it. When you flip the light on your back in the darkness of that very room, and you see the subtle changes to it. The lights switch is gone the door has no handle and the entrance can’t be found. You start to have your heart race and feel it’s in the room with you again. But the will to live kicks in, the stone body you once were now can move and the handle on the door is now there. You struggle to sit-up and move but something pulls you back down. But you fight to get up again and again. Finally you can and race to the door that feels miles away. You open it to see the blackness of the house again. The switches don’t work and once again you are pulled back but this time closing your eyes won’t make it stop. It continues to drag you somehow. When you get to the door you are trying to break the trance and you do. Only to relies when you open your eyes it’s only darkness again and the next is light. When you make it back to the lighted room you look at the windows this time and see there was never any light it was just from a light behind the curtains. You’ve been in the demons room the whole time, with everything inside you bolt to your feet and swing the door open with it slamming into the wall this time breaking the hinges, but still no sound, but the air pressure from it you feel. And you run but this time you see a light being the door of your parents room and scream for help never to be heard. As it grows closer to you, you begin to claw your way from the room. With fingers split open filling the carpet with blood you claw inch by inch to get as far away as you can. You scream for help again and again. But then you hear a sound. And you know it’s near, you go to scream but find yourself mute, as if the cords from your throat have been removed you make the action of it but no sound is heard.

I'm a journalist working on a podcast called Navigating Freedom. One episode has to do with people in prison who have written Science Fiction. Does anyone want to read a chapter or two to of one of the books (unpublished so I'll share a PDF) and give me a review for the show?

The author's name is [Bryan Mazza](https://www.theuncuffedproject.org/media) and he was put away a while ago for armed robbery. He has become a very kind and productive man, despite his surroundings. He writes in a kinda badass stylized way and will be fun if you're a fan of pulp.

Contact me with any questions. I can put you in touch if you like as well.

Thanks

Title says it all. I love brainstorming my first act, developing a premise and figuring out how a story will start to play out and unravel but I always get stuck on where I want my characters to end up at the end of the book following the (mysterious) final conflict. 

Do you have a method of figuring this out?  Do you prefer to start with the end and work your way back?"
954,WKitsune, ,0,writing,1631884013,"I finished a novel. What next?  

Hi all,

I've long since finished a novel, am decently proud of it, and have been working on editing it for some time now. However, for as well as somethings have gone, I've also struggled with not really knowing how the post-1st draft process should work, especially regarding what avenues (beta readers, editors, feedback, etc.) to pursue. I figured/hoped y'all might have some experience with how to make a novel the best it can be.

So, I suppose my question is this: what resources do people here use for things like finding beta readers or editors? Do you do manuscript swaps? What are people's general editing process? Is there anything that is particularly helpful for fantasy specifically? And really, are there any questions I'm not asking that I should be asking?

If anyone is interested, a brief description of my novel: The Queendom of Calana is a country beset by scouring magical storms, the monsters that feed on them, and unpredictable seasons. Thankfully, it has been protected since its founding by countless generations of the Four Lights, young women gifted incredible magical power by a mysterious crystal pedestal. To them falls the duty of protecting Calana against whatever threats may come. They are invariably revered as legendary heroes, and are an inspiration to all. In the present, however, all this is threatened: something has taken away a portion of the pedestal's power, and thus put the continued safety of Calana at risk. Maki Koyumi, current leader of the Four Lights, is thus forced to take her unproven and uncertain fellows out into the world to face an adversary none of them can explain. Though she doubts her abilities greatly, if Maki fails, so too does Calana...

Anyway, thank you in advance to anyone who replies to this. I eagerly look forward to being part of the community."

I understand why these get posted, writing is difficult and sometimes you feel lost and need a little confidence. However, to become a writer you also have to learn to just write, don't let fear and doubt distract you.


✏ The how do I question. This is usually a context specific question where someone has an idea that they like and instead of just writing it, they goto Reddit to ask how.

The straight answer is that no one can tell you how to write your supernatural love triangle noir with cyberpunk elements - you have to do it, put one word after another until it is done, adjust and rewrite until satisfied.

✏ The other big question is about permission. Am I allowed to do this? I understand where people are coming from because when you are learning to write it seems like there are a lot of rules and that is true. However, the secret is that as a writer you are in control. Once you learn those rules, then you can do whatever you want, even break the rules.

My advice is much the same, write it. Instead of asking permission, try it and then see if it works. Have someone read it. Rewrite as needed.

The short answer is try it, writing does not have to be perfect the first draft and experimenting is how we learn and grow. You may create a genre or unique style, not by asking permission but by trying to make things work.

970,Megalids,Advice,0,writing,1631876196,"Is my writing style overly YA/juvenile for adult novel?  So I'm working on my first serious work (as in actually more than 100 pages before I give up on idea) and I'm worried my writing is a bit too juvenile and so inappropriate for themes. Before I continue, English is not my native language, so originally I write in my mother tongue.

Its a high fantasy novel, nothing really revolutionary, I don't really intend to publish it or anything, definitely not in current form, but it's a story that I'm deeply invested in. It has three protagonist, 24M, his sister 21F and enemy duke in late 30s. The characters are regarded and think as actual adults, so there is no themes of growing up, first loves and all that stuff. I'm also trying to describe situations accurately and realistically, which includes graphic violence and sex. It also deals a lot with battle trauma, PTSD, manipulative and selfish people that actually gain and achieve their goals...

So the plot and themes are not something you would normally find in typical YA book. I'm more concerned about my writing and for it I will put a short (translated the best I could) excerpt from one of initial chapters. I also changed names of characters for it.

**Excerpt:**

The following day was completely different than the previous. Early morning sun was pleasantly heating the tent's canvas, so that even without the burning fireplace it felt almost like in a blacksmith's workshop. First time after the crushing defeat, Duke John, freshly shaved and clothed in his best yellow tunic, decided to take a stroll through the army camp. He stretched on the plateau in front of the tent and took a deep breath. The smell of burning flesh hit his nose, and it took great effort not to think where it came from.

It was there that he was intercepted by Andrew, his adviser and secretary. The grey haired man bowed energetically, his hawkish nose almost to John's waist, and started to talk before the duke could dismiss him.

""Oh sir, what a relief that to you again outside of that suffocating tent. You know, there were some rumors in the camp last three days, really nasty rumors, but don't you worry, old Andrew took care of that and-"" He noticed the stern look on John's face and stopped.

""Come, walk with me,"" said the duke.

""Yes sir."" Andrew bowed deeply and stepped on John's right flank. ""I assume you want to hear camp reports?""

""I don't know Andrew, you tell me. After all it's you who stopped me. I just wanted to take a peaceful walk...""

Andrew pretended to think, a hand scratching his chin, but John knew that he already prepared himself in advance as he always did.

You need to LIVE to make art, plain and simple.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't feel like writing today, don't make this sub (or any other online venue) your default hangout. Go buy some art supplies and take up painting or sculpting. Journal your random thoughts (*just for you -* on PAPER). Sign up for martial arts lessons. Just DO SOMETHING in the real world, because the online world is primarily a ""vast wasteland""^(1). It will leave you wandering and forlorn; it will suck out your soul if you're not careful.

To me, it's always fun when you can fall into a world, with the story plot or not.

My concern is giving my possible audience too much to chew, turning it into a chore for them instead of a delight. Perhaps confusing them if they think there's too many things to keep track of. I want people excited for the next experience, not dreading another history lesson.

I am 18, currently a college fresher and I have had passion of writing stories since I was a child.

 I have learnt to never go back to edit and and continue doing it and still somehow managed to get stuck in one chapter for a lot of months actually. I assure that I have had my ending planned out even if not in detail. I had a bare idea of how my plot will proceed here and there even though I haven't planned much details of it. And yet I somehow managed to get stuck and I left the writing for many days. I had little idea what was gonna happen in next chapter but I had no clue how to end that one. It was a chapter where I had to invent characters on spot and I did not know how they all will play role to help the story.

 Sometimes I would try again to continue that chapter but to no success. I was getting stuck to the point I am not able to move forward no matter how much I push and it left me helpless to tears. I think I did not have much of a clarity of how my world works and what I wanted to be there.

Recently, I have decided to this time have utmost clarity of what will happen in my story. I created a google docs with my story map where I decided to put clarity into everything. My world my characters, how they will develop, the plot and the history its based on. And after having clarity of how my story will carry out, I have decided to begin writing, this time everyday with no zero day and without getting stuck anywhere again.

I have a few doubts before I start so I will know when it's safe to start: 

How do people plan out their story and characters to write consistently everyday without getting stuck? How much base and clarity is required before starting the story?  What are some important things I need to know about my story before I start so I won't get stuck with the plot? What are some mistakes I need to avoid?

Are there anymore tips? I hope to never get stuck in my plot again and write uninterrupted as I will little time everyday to write my story being a full time college student. Thank you for reading all!"

Young zay had found a beautiful part of the forest where the forest floor is exposed to sunlight causing to grow grass and other wild plant matter. ""Woow, this is beautiful, Zay"" exclaimed Young Gyles, her eyes was sparkling with glitters because of how so many kinds of flowers are there in one bush. while she was admiring the flowers Zay was admiring how beautiful Gyles' face was caused him to think ""i could be with that girl"". ""Wait, no we are childhood friends, if i asked her, that feeling of her being on my side would be gone"" feared Zay. They did not know that the garden was actually a nesting place of burrowers. Burrowers are a giant kind of millipede mixed with centepede. it has an exoskeleton as strong as steel at it's back and it's weak spot is its belly, unfortunatelly the abdominal part is covered with hairs and if you touch one of those hairs you'll

""Zay no get out of the wa--"" Exclaimed Gyles to Zay until…. she was shocked at what she was looking at… it was Zay holding the head of the burrower and not even feeling the symptoms when he touched the hair. the burrower eventually calmed down.

I’ve been dying to find some truth in this massive heap of deception. Maybe it’s in your eyes, but God knows that I’m too much of a coward to look straight at them. And maybe you’ve heard it all before, but you tug at my shirt like a child who needs to hear it again.

1014,heheheheits,Advice,1,writing,1605066996,"[Essay Writing] How to provide an original and personal insight on a book that’s been analysed to death. So we’re studying 1984 and have to write an essay on it. As far as I know, every single English teacher has read thousands of essays (literally) on it, and know the book almost back to front. 

Other books I’ve read and had essays on, such as to kill a mocking bird, the great Gatsby, Shakespearean plays, were all interesting, and although it was hard to provide something ‘unique’, I still managed because I genuinely enjoyed the text and didn’t have to rely on google (too much) to find techniques. 

But 1984, I absolutely hate it (sorry if I’m offending anyone who likes it). I don’t ‘connect’ with it at all, and I can’t justify anything about how it represents human condition because I feel like it had such a little impact on me. A major factor as well is how famous of a book it is, and it’s impossible to provide a unique or personal insight, because undoubtedly a teacher would’ve read something like it already.

Bonjour,

how do you play with the reader’s expectations without killing the tension? 

 I’m writing a mystery story but instead of hiding who this mysterious killer is, and doing a big reveal, I am trying to make it kind of anticlimactic. Too obvious.  
 I know this trope isn’t exactly new but I don’t know if I’m able to build up and hold tension with this specific stylistic choice.  
 (Please excuse any mistakes, English isn’t my native language)

&amp;#x200B;

Classic scenario: protagonist arrives on an island where strange and murderous incidences happen. None of the islander can figure shit out, though, and they continue to live in fear.  
 The protagonist (and the reader) should, however, almost immediately recognize the antagonist as the bad guy and it should be really, really obvious.   
 And of course, everyone around her - my protagonist - is oblivious. Not deliberately, as they are looking for the killer as well.  
 

Here’s my problem:  
    
 I don’t want my protagonist to come across as “crazy” (you know, like in some horror movies when she’s right and no one’s believing her). She isn’t investigating these murders; she just happens to be on this island. And she doesn’t want to convince anyone because she’s A) not a detective or a police officer and B) everything seems to be fishy .  
 The reader should also be like: “yeah this person is the killer. But it’s the second chapter, that would be too obvious.”   
 So they’re waiting for this “real killer” who never appears.   
 And finally, in the last third, that woman from the second chapter – who obviously has been the killer- is revealed to be the killer. Wow. Lame. Badly written.     
 

The actual reveal should demonstrate that her doings were just the groundwork for the upcoming catastrophe in the last chapter. And it has to be a slap in the reader’s face as they were (hopefully) expecting a murder mystery.

Do I kill the tension with this choice?"

I’m fairly confident I am, but it can get discouraging sometimes. Sorry for the long post, but this is a complicated path with a lot of layers.

When I was ten, I realized I had a knack for freehand drawing and started practicing constantly. Whatever original content I drew made me cringe, so I focused on fan art or things directly from real life. This was never fulfilling because my drawings never felt like they were really mine. I would never tell other artists to feel this way, that’s just how I felt specifically. Weird, I know, but it didn’t feel like it was fully the right fit for me. In high school, I started drawing tons of original characters that I was and am still very proud of. There’s a batch of them at this point and have gotten positive feedback from friends and family.

This entire time, I’d gone through a lot of personal issues. Making comics on them felt right, but I hardly shared them with anyone. I still told myself I’d study graphic design because I love it, especially areas that involve thinking up good ideas. I put graphic novelling on the back burner and tried focusing on graphic design.

Now I’m a college underclassman, and after I thought I was CERTAIN graphic design was the right major for me, I realized a few issues. I like my classes, but I was hoping that there would be more room to be personal in our work. I didn’t realize that this was something I wanted to do, but over time I just realized that’d be a more fulfilling path to me. My most well-received high school assignments were on personal reflections and mental health. I took a lot of time to reflect, and I started to realize that I compartmentalized my passions into different categories. At the beginning I thought I’d stick with graphic design and take some writing courses on the side. I wound up switching to a different major that focuses on more areas of creative expression, writing included. It was difficult for me because I’ll miss my old major but I already prefer my upcoming courses to the ones I take now.

After years of toying around with rejected ideas, I finally made the decision to make it about aspects of my life and I finally wrote several drafts! This was huge for me. Years of planning, and I finally have a detailed plan. I’m really proud of myself and I did not know if I would get that far, but I don’t want it to end there. It has my characters, personal stuff, and allows me to practice narrative therapy. It feels complete and like a life calling. It connects all my passions into one.

I drew some storyboards, but nothing stuck. There’s a class next semester that I registered for that teaches comic/graphic novel art and this is what I hope will be the last piece of planning before I finally draw the first draft for the whole thing. It’s not for another couple months. I know it’s not guaranteed to be a success, but I’ve honestly put in so much work that I have to find out.

So I’m really wondering what I can do until next semester. I know that someone doesn’t have to take a course to draw panels but that’s truly what I’m stuck on at this point and think only that guidance could push me forward. I was stuck for years but now I’m stuck even knowing the written plan. It feels like I could just burst sometimes.

Also, is it reasonable to think that I can finish the book before I graduate college? Even if it’s not published yet, would it be reasonable to think that if I put my heart and soul into it, I could near completion? I’d appreciate any words of advice at all."

It was just enough activity to disturb my non-specific gaze, and I glanced down. A small queue of elderly women and a teenager with a skateboard.

I had been in a trance for the entire twenty or so minutes it had taken us to get here from town; we'd spent all day there, scaring the pigeons, coming up with hilarious scenarios and visiting the game shops. My mind instantly went to the half-eaten sausage roll in my backpack, sat adjacent me on an empty seat. As I rummaged through, something across the street caught my eye.

It was a man in a red t-shirt standing on the pavement, two roads down. Cars were moving fast. He was on the edge. He didn't look as though he was doing anything; no phone. His lips weren't moving either. He was just kind of, standing around. I sat there for the duration of my cold sausage roll, eyes fixated, watching his behaviour.

It must have been at least a minute before the bus inflated, and the buzz of the engine began vibrating the seats once more. At that point, he looked up and saw the bus. He saw me. Then he waved. He was smiling.

I leant over the seat and tapped my friend on the shoulder. He took a second to pull his earphones out, then I reached over him and pointed out the window. ""Do you see that guy?"" He gazed down in the general direction. ""No, where?""

""That guy in the red t-shirt!"" I adjusted my finger for accuracy.

He stood up for a second and then sat back down. By that time, the bus was moving away.

""Never mind."" I huffed, sitting back down, pissed off he hadn't seen what I'd seen.

""What was he doing?"" My friend asked curiously.

""This random guy was waving at me.""

""Did you know him?""

""I have no idea who he was.""

""Strange."" My friend paused midair, half facing me, half facing the window, looking out as if he was about to say something profound. Then he put his earphones back in and returned to his phone.

We arrived five minutes late to a warm house and roast dinner, laid out across the table in bowls and pots for self-service, courtesy of my aunt and uncle. My friend dug in, but I wasn't hungry, since I'd eaten the sausage roll. After, we played some of the new games we'd bought, upstairs in my cousin's bedroom.

For some reason I couldn't sleep that night. I couldn't get comfortable. I tossed and turned, exhausted but restless. Something inside of me was festering, like ants crawling in my stomach. I felt sick.

I got up and made myself a glass of water, then went downstairs again a few minutes later to watch some quiet TV. I remember seeing the first glimmerings of sunrise scatter over the sky through the living room window before my eyes closed and everything went black.

When they opened again, the sun was much brighter. I felt the heat of it in patches on my face. It took them a second to adjust, and for me to realise, I was peering out a different panel of glass than my aunt's living room window - the windscreen of a car; beyond it, an open carpark, and some buildings I did not recognise. Where was I?

As I breathed in, I felt my chest expand wider and deeper than it has ever done before, inhaling through my nostrils that adult car smell. My body felt bigger, heavier. As I moved slightly, tiny pins and needle sensations tickled my arms and legs: *hairs*. I had access to a strength and balance in my body I'd never experienced, though it was undermined by my sheer bewilderment.

Vague memories flashed through my mind like a frenzy of paparazzi. Images of faces, places; a bearded guy with a cap, a kitchen I'd never seen before. A bar. A street. A field. An oak tree. A stunning brunette. A hundred different shades of every colour. I suddenly felt intangible excitement. Then I felt horrifically lonely; recollections of so much hard work and anxiety. Sitting in front of a computer alone for so many nights. Arguing with people. Jesus, relationships are so hard. I let others down. I've struggled.

It felt like a lifetime of unravelling, before an unknown force blew my body to the side and flung my legs ninety degrees over the car seat, out into the breeze. I ducked my head under the door, closing it behind me and locking it with the keys, which had been mysteriously in my right hand the whole time. Another guy had just locked his car doors too. He kind of looked like me, walking obliviously across the car park, vanishing into the double doors of a nearby building.

I found myself walking without knowing why I was walking, stepping one foot over the other clumsily as though I were slightly tipsy, or a toddler taking his first steps, making my way in some unknown direction. I stopped when I got to some traffic lights. I waited, then realised a small note on the panel: ""Out of order."" I looked left and then right, and continued walking down the road.

A dozen steps more and things started hitting me. *Finally*, my mind was filling in the blanks. It started off with a general feeling of familiarity, but then the details came. Bit by bit, piece by piece, chunk by chunk. Like a jigsaw puzzle assembling itself into a grand work of art. My job. My house. My wife.

My wife.

Of course. It was her birthday today. I was running to the supermarket to get her a present on my way home from work. But, what else had I forgotten? I could sense there was more.

I stood, waiting for the information to enter my mind, the hustle and bustle of busy traffic appearing and vanishing without a moment's notice. The place felt familiar. A feeling I'd been here a thousand times; no, a million.

It was a certain happy day where it wasn't raining in Britain, but the sun was accompanied by a breeze that took the edge off the warmth and gave an electricity to the air that was otherworldly. A certain calm and reflective mood, on a certain day, at a certain time, in a certain place, and then it was just like any other sad and uncomfortable day of my life. Every day since then had been more or less the same, with a few nasty surprises scattered around the corners, and things I'd glazed over and had no time to inspect.

Flicking over the events of the past thirty or so years, hardly remembering some of them, trying not to remember others, I decided right there and then, that, despite all my hardships, my time had not been wasted.

I had a crappy stressful job and my wife wasn't something out of a fairy tale picture book, but it was my own little corner of existence I'd worked hard for, and cultivated. And as much as I resented parts of it, I cherished others.

The wheezing of a double decker bus across the street lifted my head from off the ground, and I was surprised to see someone staring at me through one of the second-story windows at the back, looking just as lost as me. I decided to return the look and waved playfully as it pulled away."

The planets of the solar system, G. P. Kuiper explains, began to solidify in the darkness, through the condensation of a fluid, shapeless nebula. AN was cold and dark. Later the Sun began to become more concentrated until it was reduced almost to its present dimensions, and in this process the temperature rose and rose, to thousands of degrees, nd the Sun started emitting radiations in space. 'itch-dark it was,--old Qfwfq confirmed,--I was only a child, can barely remember it. We were there, as usual, with Father and Mother, Granny Bb'b, some uncles and aunts who were visiting, Mr. Hnw, the one who later became a horse, and us little ones. I think I've told you before the way we lived on the nebulae: it was like lying down, we were flat and very still, turning as they turned. Not that we were lying outside, you understand, on the nebula's surface; no, it was too cold out there. We were underneath, as if we had been tucked in under a layer of fluid, grainy matter. There was no way of telling time; whenever we started counting the nebula's turns there were disagreements, because we didn't have any reference points in the darkness, and we ended up arguing. So we preferred to let the centuries flow by as if they were minutes; there was nothing to do but wait, keep covered as best we could, doze, speak out now and then to make sure we were all still there; and, naturally, scratch ourselves; becaus--they can say what they like all those particles spinning around had only one effect, a troublesome itching. What we were waiting for, nobody could have said; to be sure, Granny Bb'b remembered back to the times when matter was uniformly scattered in space, and there was heat and light; even allowing for all the exaggerations there must have been in those old folks' tales, those times had surely been better in someways, or at least different; but as far as we were concerned, we just had to get through that enormous night. My sister G'd(w)"" fared the best, thanks to her introverted nature: she was a shy girl and she loved the dark. For herself, always chose to stay in places that were a bit removed, at the edge of the nebula, and she would contemplate the blackness, and toy with the little grains of dust in tiny cascades, and talk to herself, with faint bursts of laughter that were like tiny cascades of dust, and-waking or sleeping-she abandoned herself to dreams. They weren't dreams like ours (in the midst of the darkness, we dreamed of more darkness, because nothing else came into our minds); no, she dreamed-from what we could understand of her ravings--of a darkness a hundred times deeper and more various and velvety. My father was the first to notice something was changing. I had dozed off, when his shout awakened me: ""Watch out! We're hitting something!"" Beneath us, the nebula's matter, instead of fluid as it had always been, was beginning to condense. To tell the truth, my mother had been tossing and turning for several hours, saying: ""Uff, I just can't seem to make myself comfortable here!"" In other words, according to her, she had become aware of a change in the place where she was lying: the dust wasn't the same as it had been before, soft, elastic, uniform, so you could wallow in it as much as you liked without leaving any print; instead, a kind of rut or furrow was being formed, especially where she was accustomed to resting all her weight. And she thought she could feel underneath her something like granules or blobs or bumps; which perhaps, after all, were buried hundreds of miles farther down and were pressing through all those layers of soft dust. Not that we generally paid much attention to these premonitions of my mother's: poor thing, for a hypersensitive creature like herself, and already well along in years, our way of life then was hardly ideal for the nerves. And then it was my brother Rwzfs, an infant at the time; at a certain point I felt him-who knows?-slamming or digging or writhing in some way, and I asked: ""What are you doing?"" And he said: ""I'm playing."" ""Playing? With what?"" ""With a thing,"" he said. you understand? It was the first time. There had never been things to play with before. And how could we have played? With that pap of gaseous matter? Some fun: that sort of stuff was all right perhaps for my sister If Rwzfs was playing, it meant he had found something new: in fact, afterwards, exaggerating as usual, they said be had found a pebble. It wasn't a pebble, but it was surely a collection of more solid matter or-let's say--something less gaseous. He was never very clear on this point; that is, he told stories, as they occurred to hi, and when the period came when nickel was formed and nobody talked of anything but nickel, he said: ""That's it: it was nickel. I was playing with some nickel!"" So afterwards he was always called ""Nickel Rwzfs."" (It wasn't, as some say now, that he had turned into nickel, unable-retarded as he was--to go beyond the mineral phase; it was a different thing ogether, and I only mention this out of love for truth, not cause he was my brother: he had always been a bit backward, ue enough, but not of the metallic type, if anything a bit coldal; in fact, when he was still very young, he married an alga, e of the first, and we never heard from him again.) In short, it seemed everyone had felt something: except me. aybe it's because I'm absent-minded. I heard-I don't know whether awake or asleep--our father's cry: ""We're hitting something!,"" a meaningless expression (since before then nothing had ever hit anything, you can be sure), but one that took on meaning at the very moment it was uttered, that is, it meant the sensation we were beginning to experience, slightly nauseating, like a slab of mud passing under us, something flat, on which we felt we were bouncing. And I said, in a reproachful tone: "" Oh, Granny!"" Afterwards I often asked myself why my first reaction was to become angry with our grandmother. Granny Bb'b, who clung to her habits of the old days often did embarrassing 21  things: she continued to believe that matter was expansion and, for example, that it was enough to throw refuse anywhere and it would rarefy and disappear into the distance. The fact that the process of condensation had begun some while ago, that is, that dirt thickened on particles so we weren't able to get rid of it-she couldn't get thii into her head. So in some obscure way I connected this new fact of ""hitting"" with some mistake my grandmother might have made and I let out that cry. Then Granny Bb'b answered: ""What is it? Have you found my cushion?"" This cushion was a little ellipsoid of galactic matter Granny had found somewhere or other during the first cataclysms of the universe; and she always carried it around with her, to sit on. At a certain point, during the great night, it had been lost, and she accused me of having hidden it from her. Now, it was true I had always hated that cushion, it seemed so vulgar and out of place on our nebula, but the most Granny could blame me for was not having guarded it always as she had wanted me to. Even my father, who was always very respectful toward her, couldn't help remarking: ""Oh see here, Mamma, something is happening-we don't know what-and you go on about that cushion!"" ""Ah, I told you I couldn't get to sleep!"" my mother said: another remark hardly appropriate to the situation. At that point we heard a great ""Pwack! Wack! Sgrr!"" and we realized that something must have happened to Mr. Hnw: he was hawking and spitting for all he was worth. ""Mr. Hnw! Mr. Hnw! Get hold of yourself! Where's he got to now?"" my father started saying, and in that darkness, still without a ray of light, we managed to grope until we found him and could hoist him onto the surface of the nebula, where he caught his breath again. We laid him out on that external layer which was then taking on a clotted, slippery consistency. ""Wrrak! This stuff closes on you!"" Mr. Hnw tried to say, though he didn't have a great gift for self-expression. ""You go down and down, and you swallow! Skrrrack!"" He spat. There was another novelty: if you weren't careful, you would now sink on the nebula. My mother, with a mother's instinct, was the first to realiie it. And she cried: ""Children: are you all there? Where are you?"" The truth was that we were a bit confused, and whereas before, when everything had been lying regularly for centuries, we were always careful not to scatter, now we had forgotten all about it. ""Keep calm. Nobody must stray,"" my father said. ""G'd(w)n! Where are you? And the twins? Has anybody seen the twins? Speak up!"" Nobody answered. ""Oh, my goodness, they're lost!"" Mother shouted. My little brothers weren't yet old enough to know how to transmit any message: so they got lost easily and had to be watched over constantly. ""I'll go look for them!"" I said. ""Good for you, Qfwfq, yes, go!"" Father and Mother said, then, immediately repentant: ""But if you do go, you'll be lost, too! No, stay here. Oh, all right, go, but let us know where you are: whistle!"" I began to walk in the darkness, in the marshy condensation of that nebula, emitting a constant whistle. I say ""walk""; I mean a way of moving over the surface, inconceivable until a few minutes earlier, and it was already an achievement to attempt it now, because the matter offered such little resistance that, if you weren't careful, instead of proceeding on the surface you sank sideways or even vertically and were buried. But , in whatever direction I went and at whatever level, the chances of finding the twins remained the same: who could guess where the two of them had got to? All of a sudden I sprawled; as if they had-we would say today-tripped me up. It was the first time I had fallen, I didn't know what ""to fall"" was, but we were still on the softness and I didn't hurt myself. ""Don't trample here,"" a voice said, ""I don't want you to, Qfwfq."" It was the voice of my sister G'd(w)n.""Why? What's there?"" ""I made some things with things . . ."" she said. It took me a while to realize, groping, that my sister, messing about with 23  that sort of mud, had built up a little hill, all full of pinnacles, spires, and'battlements. ""What have you done there?' never gave you a straight answer. ""An outside with an inside in it."" I continued my walk, falling every now and then. I also stumbled over the inevitable Mr. Hnw, who was stuck in the condensing matter again, head-first. ""Come, Mr. Hnw. Mr. Hnw! Can't you possibly stay erect?"" and I had to help him pull himself out once more, this time pushing him from below, because I was also completely immersed. Mr. Hnw, coughing and puffing and sneezing (it had never been so icy cold before), popped up on the surface at the very spot where Granny Bb'b was sitting. Granny flew into the air, immediately overcome with emotion: ""My grandchildren! My grandchildren are back!"" ""No, no, Mamma. Look, it's Mr. Hnw!"" Everything was confused. ""But the grandchildren?"" ""They're here!"" I shouted, ""and the cushion is here, too!"" The twins must long before have made a secret hiding place for themselves in the thickness of the nebula, and they had hidden the cushion there, to play with. As long as matter had been fluid, they could float in there and do somersaults through the round cushion, but now they were imprisoned in a kind of spongy cream: the cushion's central hole was clogged up, and they felt crushed on all sides. ""Hang on to the cushion,"" I tried to make them understand. ""I'll pull you out, you little fools!"" I pulled and pulled and, at a certain point, before they knew what was happening, they were already rolling about on the surface, now covered with a scabby film like the white of an egg. The cushion, instead, dissolved as soon as it emerged. There was no use trying to understand the phenomena that took place in those days; and there was no use trying to explain to Granny Bb'b. Just then, as if they couldn't have chosen a better moment, our visiting relatives got up slowly and said: ""Well, it's getting late; I wonder what our children are up to. We're a little wor24 real an ried about them. It's been nice seeing all of you again, but we'd better be getting along."" Nobody could say they were wrong; in fact, they should have taken fright and run off long since; but this couple, perhaps because of the out-of-the-way place where they lived, were a bit gauche. Perhaps they had been on pins and needles all this time and hadn't dared say so. My father said: ""Well, if you want to go, I won't try to keep you. But thii it over: maybe it would be wiser to stay until the situation's cleared up a bit, because as things stand now, you don't know what sort of risk you might be running."" Good, common sense, in short. But they insisted: ""No, no, thanks all the same. It's been a al nice get-together, but we won't intrude on you any longer,"" d more nonsense of the sort. In other words, we may not have understood very much of the situation, but they had no notion of it at all. There were three of them: an aunt and two uncles, all three  tall and practically identical; we never really understood which uncle was the husband and which the brother, or how exactly they were related to us: in those days there were many things that were left vague. They began to go off, one at a time, each in a different direction, toward the black sky, and every now and then, as if to maintain contact, they cried: ""Oh! Oh!"" They always acted like this: they weren't capable of behaving with any sort of system. They had hardly left when their cries of ""Oh! Oh!"" could be heard from very distant points, though they ought to have been still only a few paces away. And we could also hear some exclamations of theirs, whose meaning we couldn't understand: ""Why, it's hollow here!"" ""You can't get past this spot!"" ""Then why don't you come here?"" ""'Where are you?"" ""Jump!"" ""F'me! And what do I jump over?"" ""Oh, but now we're heading back again!"" In other words, everything was incomprehensible, except the fact that some enormous distances were stretching out between us and those relatives. It was our aunt, the last to leave, whose yells made the most sense: ""Here I am, all alone, stuck on top of a piece of this stuff that's come loose . . ."" And the voices of the two uncles, weak now in the distance, repeated: ""Fool . . . Fool . . . Fool . . ."" We were peering into this darkness, crisscrossed with voices, when the change took place: the only real, great change I've ever happened to witness, and compared to it the rest is nothing. I mean this thing that began at the horizon, this vibration which didn't resemble those we then called sounds, or those now called the ""bitting"" vibrations, or any others; a kind of eruption, distant surely, and yet, at the same time, it made what was close wme closer; in other words, all the darkness was suddenly dark in contrast with something else that wasn't darkness, namely light. As soon as we wuld make a more careful analysis of the situation, it turned out that: first, the sky was dark as before but was beginning to be not so dark; second, the surface where we were was all bumpy and crusty, an ice so dii it was revolting, which was rapidly dissolving because the temperature was rising at full speed; and, thud, there was what we would later have called a source of light, that is, a mass that was becoming incandescent, separated from us by an enormous empty space, and it seemed to be trying out all the colors one by one, in iridescent fits and starts. And there was more: in the midst of the sky, between us and that incandescent mass, a couple of islands, brightly lighted and vague, which whirled in the void with our uncles on them and other people, reduced to distant shadows, letting out a kind of chirping noise. So the better part was done: the heart of the nebula, contracting, had developed warmth and light, and now there was the Sun. All the rest went on revolving nearby, divided and clotted into various pieces, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and others farther on, and whoever was on them, stayed where he was. And, above all, it was deathly hot. We stood there, open-mouthed, erect, except for Mr. Hnw who was on all fours, to be on the safe side. And my grandmother! How she laughed! As I said before, Granny Bb'b dated from the age of diffused luminosity, and all through this dark time she had kept saying that any minute things would go back the way they had been in the old days. Now her moment seemed to have come; for a while she tried to act casual, the sort of person wbo accepts anything that happens as perfectly natural; then, seeing we paid her no attention, she started laughing and calling us: ""Bunch of ignorant louts . . . Knownothings . . ."" She wasn't speaking quite in good faith, however; unless her memory by then had begun to fail her. My father, understanding what little he did, said to her, prudently as always: ""Mamma, I know what you mean, but really, this seems quite a different phenomenon . . ."" And he pointed to the terrain: ""Look down!"" he exclaimed. We lowered our eyes. The Earth which supported us was still a gelatinous, diaphanous mass, growing more and more firm and opaque, beginning from the center where a kind of yolk was thickening; but still our eyes managed to penetrate through it, illuminated as it was by that first Sun. And in the midst of this kind of transparent bubble we saw a shadow moving, as if swimming and flying. And our mother said: ""Daughter!"" We all recognized G'd (w) n frightened perhaps by the Sun's catching fire, following a reaction of her shy spirit, she had sunk into the condensing matter of the Earth, and now she was trying to clear a path for herself in the depths of the planet, and she looked like a gold and silver buttefly as she into a zone that was still illuminated and diaphanous or vanished into the sphere of shadow that was growing wider and wider  
""G'd (w) n! G'd (w) n !"" we shouted and flung ourselves on the ground, also trying to clear a way, to reach her. But the Earth's surface now was coagulating more and more into a porous husk, and my brother Rwzfs, who had managed to stick his head into a fissure, was almost strangled. Then she was seen no more: the solid zone now occupied the whole central part of the planet. My sister bad remained in there, and I never found out whether she had stayed buried in those depths or whether she bad reached safety on the other side until I met her, much later, at Canberra in 1912, married to a certain Sullivan, a retired railroad man, so changed I hardly recognized her. We got up. Mr. Hnw and Granny were in front of us, crying, surrounded by pale blue-and-gold flames. ""Rwzfs! Why have you set fire to Granny?"" Father began to scold, but, turning toward my brother, he saw that Rwzfs was also enveloped in flames. And so was my father, and my mother, too, and I-we were all burning in the fire. Or rather: we weren't burning, we were immersed in it as in a dazzling forest; the flames shot high over the whole surface of the planet, a fiery air in which we could run and float and fly, and we were gripped by a kind of new joy. The Sun's radiations were burning the envelopes of the planets, made of helium and hydrogen: in the sky, where our uncles and aunt were, fiery globes spun, dragging after them long beards of gold and turquoise, as a comet drags its tail. The darkness came back. By now we were sure that everything that could possibly happen had happened, and ""yes, this is the end,"" Grandmother said, ""mind what us old folks say . . ."" Instead, the Earth had merely made one of its turns. It was night. Everything was just beginning."

But when it came down to either I always found myself leaning into the paranormal/romance sort of genre. I've enjoy it and have read pretty much anything I can get my hands on, more so I'm drawn to the realm of the Vampires. Pretty cut and dry concept, put your own twist on it and bam.. story!

My dilemma is that I also am an avid believer in writing what you know. I live in a beautiful place and I feel I'd be able to do it justice with my writing. The issue is..this area in which I live was the location for by far the most popular young adult paranormal romance books, which features ""Vampires"" who...sparkle...Gross..

I'd be straying far away from the young adult category and would be going for a more traditional vampire. But I'm just really worried that even if I stay as far away from the for mentioned stuff that if I were to write and attempt to publish it would be seen as me doing fanfiction purely because of the location of the story and the fact that Vampires are a thing.  

So I suppose what I am asking is would you just go for it regardless and hope your take wouldn't be seen as fanfiction or would you go against the grain of what you'd normally do and pick another location? My main goal is to create something that I'd be publishing. 

Just looking for other view points really, cheers!"

1048,lemonlyss,Advice,39,writing,1605048907,"A simple test you can use to make sure your primary characters are properly motivated and developed Over the years, my writing group and I have refined this checklist for what makes a character work. We reduced it down to 5 simple categories. It's basically a check of your primary character's motivations. There are 5 categories describing a character's arc throughout a classical story, and if you can't fit your character into any of the boxes, then you've discovered a weakness that might prevent your story from being marketable. It's very handy.

The 5 categories that make this classic story arc are:


* **NEED:** This is a core emotional need that leads to self-actualization that your character's arc will focus on (see: Maslow's hierarchy of needs). Respect, freedom, belonging, intimacy, and validation are some examples of basic emotional needs. During the story, the character will have a need taken away from them, and they will have to get it back.

* **OATH:** This is a complicated one that I haven't seen often eleswhere. It's condition that bonds your character to the world. It's a kind of promise, either to themselves, to others, or to the something greater. They may not consciously realize that it's a promise. Nonetheless, it strengthens the classic character arc. It's something that your character can never break without losing all hope. It may be the safety of something or someone they care about - a sibling, a loved one, or a home. Or it may be an oath to themselves, an oath to be honorable, an oath to never succumb to evil, an oath to live up to (or never live up to) the wishes of their parents. During the story, your character may come close to breaking the oath, or they may break it in a way that can be reversed or atoned for, but they will *always* correct themselves. The oath being in danger is the fastest path to resolution of the story. In a way, it's their lifeline to what they need.

* **HURT:** This is a compromising situation, a metaphorical thorn or barb in the character's side, that compromises the need defined at the top of the list. This is a situation your character cannot escape without facing challenges they aren't ready for, but that upsets the balance of their life and prevents them from reaching self-actualization.

* **PATH:** This is a collection of things your character falsely believes due to the above hurt, and it will be the primary source of their actions leading to escalating stakes throughout the story. It is a path motivated by the painful scenario that leads directly to an ultimatum, as the lies can't be maintained in the face of high enough danger, and will eventually collapse as your character struggles more and more to hold them together.

* **FORK:** This is the ultimatum at the end of the path above. Rising stakes will push your character to a point where they can no longer fall back on the false path, and there will be one moment during the climax where they have to pick between two choices. One choice fulfills their oath and satisfies their need, but at the cost of all the steps they've taken on their false path. The other choice keeps with the comfort of their false path, but risks breaking their oath, destroying their one chance to achieve self-actualization.

Here is an example, the protagonist of a novel I am working on:

&gt; **NEED:** To live with agency, to feel that she is satisfied with her own life morals and beliefs.

&gt; **OATH:** Her earliest happy memories were from a time when her mother took care of her in her, before conflict was high and before her father became violent. When that time ended, she saw first-hand evidence of true, inexplicable evil. She decided she cannot let evil take anything from good people ever again.

&gt; **HURT:** Due to the conflict-ridden state of the world, wherever she goes and whoever she considers as family, she ends up oppressed by the people superior to her and told to believe things she didn't pick herself.

&gt; **PATH:** She decides that in order to be happy, she has to live for herself. She begins resisting scenarios in which she must work together with others. Along the way, she rejects helping those who need it, as she subconsciously fears that imposing her own morals on others will contradict her views on independence.

&gt; **FORK:** Somebody saves her life just as the world's conflict is reaching its climax. She sees an opportunity to help others resist the very same evil that took away her childhood. If she waits too long, she will miss it, and the evil in herself may take root. But accepting will prove that her ideas about independence have been misguided. Her savior is walking away; this is her last chance to take a stand.

By filling out the categories, I was able to identify that my character didn't have a concrete oath. The above version is much stronger than what I had before.

I recommend filling in the categories with your own primary characters. If one doesn't fit, try creating an alternate version that fits into all the boxes. The new version will probably be stronger than the old one. I'm quite curious to see what others will fill in with their characters."

All my stories have been only read by me, and I've been kinda reluctant to show any of my writings until this point (and age), because now I think I've achieved enough maturity and experience to make something decent enough to become a novel, or decent enough to be read haha.

My father is just too strict, too complicated, too cold, he's the last person I'd let to read the book. My friends were open to it, and somehow I never touched the idea again with some of them. Only a couple received it but never gave me an answer, they just didn't read it, and I don't dare to ask a third time. My grandmother read it, she loves reading books, but she's a grandma, she is just deliriously happy that I write, she just told me she liked it a lot and wants to read more, she didn't say anything else. She doesn't even like this genre, she wouldn't read this story otherwise.

My sister read it, she told me she read until the fifth chapter and while I was talking to her... I just realized she didn't even finish the first chapter. Even though, her review helped me enough to make me rethink and edit things that I realized weren't working well. Now it's been almost two months and she just skips - I know Netflix is more entertaining, I know she works a lot of hours, but she was my last hope. God, last thing I told her was ""hey I think I know what the title's gonna be"" and she just say ""aaaah"" and changed the topic. It's too frustrating.

The story is sci-fi and has a lot of suspense, it has some philosophical ""questions"" on it. I struggle like hell with the start, and I know that must be the thing that makes it hard to be read, I even changed it a couple of times. It's heavy, it's not a Harry Potter story that'd be entertaining even for a 12 yo kid. I'm totally open to make changes as long as it works with what I have in mind, but there are limits. Also, I don't like the idea of beta readers and I believe I won't be able to find one in spanish, I don't know if I'll trust anyone besides acquaintances to read it. I know serious people who can read it, like my uncle who's a journalist, but they're busy, or I'd only give it to them when I feel its very very well written. Perhaps, sci-fi it's not a genre for all people and it can be very weird if you never read it. 

I'm struggling to keep going, my motivation turns on one day then the other it dies, I sometimes question myself if a chapter or scene is too ridiculous, etc. So now I question, what to do? My plan Z right now is to give it to my grandpa (I might get the same grandma result), or pay a friend to encourage the reading. 

Does anyone have any other ideas? If you share your experience I'd love to hear it since it can help me.  Maybe I need more patience, or I need to act more like an Amway/Herbalife recruit. I don't know anymore."

From a third person perspective, how does this work for the character you are following? Do you still say, ""Eliza's cheeks grew warm"" or would that change to ""Eliza blushed."""

Ok, I'm currently writing a story and it consists of three different forms of magic, one is hereditary magic, the population is more likely to inherit powers if their relatives have powers, magic is activated like a sharingan with a very strong specific emotion unique to a person. Then they can slowly control and activate the powers better over time without that emotion being present, all tpes of magic used by people change their physical appearance, most commonly is the whites of the eyes turn black and the pupils different colors. The second type of magic system is mineral, there are certain ores like Tykenium that have magic properties, being released through heat, etc. this type of magic can affect the environment and make the things around it sentient or have powers as long as they were all ready living, like radioactive waste in some aspects. The final magic system will be artificial, it will be man made, and have similar effects to hereditary magic but will have side effects such as lead poisoning etc. but I don't know how to make it work or how to write hard magic systems, any advice, please?"

Without saying too much about my story, my current antagonist is definitely  evil, and my protagonist has a good motivation, but my antagonist doesn’t necessarily do anything unlawfully evil. My antagonist and protagonist are both hired officials for the Highest position in my world. The antagonist abuses his power, mistreats people, and does what he wants since he’s protected by his position. My protagonist has his own  ideals, and although my antagonist doesn’t break any (in universe) laws, my protagonist tries to get in this way.

This is a double edged sword because the antagonist helps the country a lot even with his shorty actions and characteristics , so no other official bothers him since he gets things done. My protagonist ends up trying his hardest to get my antagonist out of his position, so most of my antagonist’s actions are just in response to the protagonist. 

My antagonist ends up losing his job after my protagonist does some (in universe) sketchy and unlawful things to get rid of him. So now the balance in power for the officials has a massive hole and overall they’re worse off.

None of the conflict is caused by my antagonist, even though he is evil. My protagonist starts the conflict based off his own ideals. So instead of my antagonist having a goal that opposes my protagonist, he pretty much has none."

I consider myself to be generally well-read and educated person, but I've been increasingly frustrated by the limitations of my own vocabulary. 

Better writers manage to be direct but not blunt or crude simply because it's clear they just have an astonishing grasp on language and know exactly how to express themselves. They use words like scalpels, and I don't understand how, but I want to find a way to be more like them. I keep slipping into the realm of ""purple"" prose just because I feel the need to layer less sophisticated metaphors to reach for the same effect.

I'm working on reading more, especially in the realms of classical literature and mythology, since I find that's where a lot of ubiquitous references and shorthand can be found and understood deeper than just surface-level. I've done the whole ""word-of-the-day"" thing in the past, but those hardly ever stick and they're rarely what I actually need or am looking for. 

It's just so frustrating to know exactly what I want to say but not know how to say it, or have it come out wrong when I try. Has anyone else felt this way? Have you figured out any ways to overcome it or at least keep it at bay?"

1067,Knight-Jack,Advice,5,writing,1605040988,"Need an opinion on a scene I'm just not sure how much ""extra"" would be too much. Because you always need to provide some context. 

It's an opening scene. I needed my characters to run wildly, so they wouldn't notice a trap. I need this trap, it's plot relevant, but it's practically impossible to hide, so I need my characters to be thoroughly distracted.

So I started thinking - okay, so let's say they get to an inn, where they get in some serious trouble and accidentally the inn burns down, they get blamed, the chase starts. I started writing it, and it got me an excuse to show how irritable the main character is, how short his fuse, how much he hates being around humans (which would give context to later scenes, where he would need to accept that he actually needs help sometimes and will need a party eventually), and also a bit about the world, just snippets, cause I didn't want to waste too much time on something I can explain as the plot reveals itself. I got to show some characters and their approach to the world in general. I got to show off my character's trade and a bit of his powers. Just a tease.

BUT... this inn is not plot relevant. The characters will move on (in a hurry at start) and the plot will go with them. The reader will never meet these random characters at the inn. I just need this inn to burn down so that the characters could start running. But I had so much fun just writing all these passing remarks on what could come soon - the world, the plot, the powers, the people and their approach - that I'm almost 4 A4 pages in and I think I'll need a bit more to actually wrap it up. 

I don't *think* I'm wasting reader's time, not with all the plot-relevant remarks, but the fact that the inn itself is not plot-relevant, just gnaws me.

But in the same time, if I would just write ""they were running. how on earth were they supposed to know that the inn was so flammable, or that the people would be so upset about it? but it was and they were, so now OCs had no other choice but to run for their lives"" I would need to cut all this information I managed to fit in, and will need to put it sometime later, when I wouldn't need to do it, if I would leave the story as it is.

BUT the inn isn't plot-relevant and won't come back...

I'm just running in circles. Would love some opinion."

How can we even come anywhere near resonating if we don't try? If we don't taste? Taste various forms of passions. ""Trial and Error"", when Really it is ""Trial and Learning"".

Why is it that when we as a society have a passion for something we are so quick to think of what to do, or maybe the first moves but it takes so long sometimes for the action to come in place? Why do we care about other peoples opinions so much that it allows us to stand still? Instead of trying, either being successful with our idea, or learning what we liked about that said focus, what we didn't and what we can do better next time.

I believe truly that when the Knowing tells you what your next move should be, FOLLOW IT. Remove the need of thinking about your friends, family, guardian, partner, acquaintances etc. They aren't you and most definitely you aren't them. Why Worry?

If you want to start a business, Start. If you want to use your voice to make change in the world, Start. If you want to start doing yoga outside in the park, Start. If you want to write a book, Start. If you want to dance in the rain, Start. More importantly, DO. Act on what you feel is right for you.

We have 1 life. 1 chance with many chances to learn, fail (learn), grow, evolve and be our true authentic self by becoming fearless.

Fearlessness is not the fact that you don't fear things, but even though the fear has come into your eyesight, you still PERSEVERE. IT feels good as well. The pain, the fear, of yourself, societies ""judgment"", the unknown, can be scary, but the most beautiful part of life is that when YOU follow through, YOU do what YOU know is right for YOU, You will look back and say to yourself, ""I was scared of doing that?"" and laugh. With Happiness and Empowerment that you have started your Journey, which we ARE ALWAYS ON........ but thats a conversation for another day.

I've recently finished watching two series of Brandon Sanderson's lectures on being an author. I've found these useful and would recommend them to anyone looking to learn more about the craft. Sanderson tends to focus on plot, character, setting, and the industry itself - he does it in a 'big picture' way.

I'm therefore looking for similar resources that look at improving command of language and storytelling at a more detailed level. 

I've recently been working through many books on the subject; Forsyth, Le Guin etc. But I like to watch lectures while I work my day job, so any suggestions here would be appreciated. 

Thanks!"

I included some lyrics by two indie bands, and the story itself is reminiscent of a 90s surreal movie. I was at this party down at the punch table swallowing punch. Then suddenly this guy walked up to me and said, “I want to introduce you to someone.” I looked up, startled and noticed another person behind him. God, that was strange to see you again, introduced by a friend of a friend. Our gazes met and there was a flash of recognition in both our heads. 

People called it deja-vu, but this was different. I had seen this woman before. And she knew it too. Our mutual acquaintance broke the silence, first facing me: “Scott, this is Lyra. Lyra,” he spoke now directly to her, “this is Scott.” Still neither of us said a word. Our eyes looked at each other. I swallowed hard like I understood, and cleared my throat. “I, um, um, pleased to meet you”, extending my hand towards her. She was swift in responding the gesture and laid her palm inside mine, shaking it. Then she threw out the magic words: “We’ve met before, haven’t we?” I was taken aback by how sinister this sounded. It wasn’t her voice by which I was surprised, she sounded lovely and just the way I remembered. But those words she said, I knew I heard them somewhere. I had seen a lot of movies but couldn’t come up with the title where this quote came from. Then it dawned upon me, like a shooting star from the heavens. “Lost Highway!” I wasn’t aware I said it out loud, but noticed it immediately when I saw both Lyra and the other guy with quizzical faces. I explained myself. “Sorry what you just said reminded me of a scene in the movie Lost Highway.” She laughed and said: “Oh Scott, you haven’t changed a bit in all these years we haven’t seen each other!” 

Meanwhile the guy who’d introduced us, who went by the name of Jonny, had disappeared into the crowd. We were alone, standing at the punch table not swallowing punch this time. I saw she wasn’t drinking anything, so inquired if she needed some punch. She said she’d love to have some, so I grabbed the ladle and put some in a cup. She took it gratefully and then we faced each other again. “Wow you really can stare someone to death with those eyes,” I said to break the ice. She smiled again. Next we went straight to business.

Me: “What are you doing here?”

She: “What am I doing here? Well I’m invited of course. You’re not the only one with cool friends who organize the best parties in town.”

Me: “I see, just surprised to see you. After all this time. I thought I’d never see you again. It’s like you disappeared from the side of the earth.”

She: “Well as a matter of fact I did.”

Me: “You didn’t go into space, did you.”

She: “No Scott, ‘course not. You were always so easily fooled.” She took my nose between her fingers to prove her point.

Me: “Well what do you mean then?”

She: “After our break-up I avoided all possible places where I could encounter you. I needed to feel freedom again. Needed to feel we weren’t dependent on each other.”

Me: “You broke my heart by doing that.” My tone suddenly became less joyous and more fierce. I felt anger welling up inside me. All the emotions I had buried inside were coming to the surface. In a moment I’d be crying and yelling, I had to find a way out. “Go the fuck away Lyra, it’s enough that you come here, you have the right to be here, I acknowledge that. But how do you dare to speak to me again, introducing yourself by a friend of a friend? You have some nerve to think I could be still interested.”

She answered my anger with calmness, but very firmly she said: “Scott, you’re so wrong about everything. You never understood anything. Saying hi doesn’t mean you want to fuck someone. If you still aren’t over me, then that’s your problem. Don’t burden me with your pain.”

I said nothing and walked away. 

She yelled: “Yes walk away already, that was always your solution to everything. You can never face problems, that was the primary reason I left you. Go fuck yourself Scott.”"

Several people upvoted the prologue, only to stop reading at the part i made during the time stress took over my mind.

For those that use Microsoft word. Grammarly is a really useful add on. It helps with grammar and spell checking and is far superior to the spellchecker that comes with word. You do need to create an account and there is the option of buying premium. I have yet to do that but find the free version really useful. 

Prowriting Aid is a really great free chrome extension. It helps with spelling, grammar, style, sticky words plus plenty more. It is recommended that you only run the numerous reports on 500 word pieces at a time. But for a free extension it really works great. There is an option to buy the premium service too which I haven't yet done. But really find this useful when editing. 

Writersdiet.com offers a free test of up to around 1000 words. It doesn't tell you which words to cut etc but does state which words are prepositions etc. Really handy if you really dislike say adjectives and want to limit how many you use. This is another free aid.

Like, if they encounter a tree, how do you describe a tree in the way that they would see it? A tree is a tree. And THAT tree, with all its branches and roots in their specific places, couldn’t possibly be different, no matter who is looking at it.

Good Morning Megan,

I hope all is well. I read your short story and it was great. I enjoyed how you had three main characters with a villian. Your story also had two meanings behind it which I think was powerful as well. The power of reading and power of friendship. I am ready for the next short story. Will Kaira, Minty, and Giovanni become true guardians? Will they build their skills in the Magica Library? Will they ever see the Guardians Grimoire? I think this is a story plot that you could continue to build on.

I was also wondering if I could get a publicity form signed from you. I would like post your History in Progress poem on our fb page. Also, we would like to use some of your other work, like Invisible Wings. Please let me know if that is something that you would be willing to do. I look forward to hearing from you.

I'm a beginner writer trying to write in the essay form. I like the essay because I have a lot to say, but my issue is I have more to say than I can handle.

In school, essays were a huge hurdle for me, even though I enjoy writing. They were hard to start and hard to write, because I felt like my ideas were too big and important to me for my writing ability to do justice to. 

Every time I had an essay, I spent long hours trying to wrangle my ideas, and I usually did eventually, but it was so emotionally and mentally draining it almost wasn't worth it. Writing essays started to become something I was afraid of because I knew it would be a long battle of frustration and feeling incompetent. The feeling of finding the right words (when I finally found them,) was amazing... But it just barely redeemed the whole process of writing for me.

I've had years of academic practice with writing essays (studied English in college) but the same struggle of writing them happens every time. I thought as time went on I'd get better and the emotional and mental strain would let up a little, but it hasn't. I've had old classmates tell me they write 5 page essays in 30-60 minutes... meanwhile I spent hours and hours finding the right words, the right segues, the right order to present things.

I worry that I have an unhealthy attitude/approach toward writing, and that has to be why it's never gotten easier. I do expect a masterpiece, a perfectly expressed string of ideas every time I produce an essay, but is that unrealistic? I feel like the expectation of being able to express myself isn't a high bar, so I feel so discouraged when I can't, or at least can't without putting myself through hell every time.

What would your advice be? Am I taking on too much trying to tackle my big ideas right now? I feel like big ideas are the only ones worth writing about sometimes. At the same time, I think I may be trying to stretch myself beyond my ability which is why the process is so hard on me. Maybe I just have a hard time organizing my thoughts. I don't know.

Hello there, I hope that you are well and making good memories in these trying times!
I’m a person who writes quite often- and have always wanted to do something major (besides my day to day academic essays). 

We need two people who are free enough to write at least 5 paragraphs per day- these paragraphs are not going to be a single piece, but each are responses to whatever else that is happening in the story. These very writings are in perspectives of a character (it’s like playing a role in a movie/show). We also want our writers to be as invested in helping eachother- since it’s not much of a job but a learning experience and hobby for all of us!

The plot takes place in the Soviet Union. The year 1940 has just started and the poor are starving. There are 5 children who want to escape and live a better life- wanting to go to “the end of the world”- where they figure to be the South Pole. Something about it seems peaceful to them (with the reasoning being dependent on the character). 

If you are willing, message me on here!

While first-person is used to make stronger connections with the MC and to give a greater sense of danger, I think third-person allows to be more descriptive.

I remember reading a book where the MC was like ""I was so terrified"" ""I was so scared"" whenever she saw a monster. Every single time. It got incredibly annoying, which is definitely a con for first-person. IMO it also depends on showing-not-telling. Like, instead of saying ""I was so scared"" or ""I was so terrified"" say ""I screamed"" or ""I ran as far as I could"" or change the way the character speaks so you can feel they're indeed scared.

I’m worried I will not be able to pass off my work as my own, and I’m unclear on where being inspired by something borders on stealing. 

The characters I wrote all have identities of which the comparison to those in the movies doesn’t go further than some superficial elements, but I worry the plot is too similar. I’m not sure if anyone has the time or energy to go through al this, but here’s a very brief summary of my plot: 

Main character is a girl that lives in the desert 

Her mother, a ‘freedom fighter’ was killed by the bad guys (before plot) 

Her father is kidnapped by the bad guys (during plot)

Girl finds photo of late mother with a male pilot she doesn’t recognize 

Girl goes to find said pilot 

Pilot is grumpy old man living on his own in a forrest 

Girl convinces pilot to train her in flying and fighting so she can go and rescue her dad and other freedom fighters

A seemingly random boy also comes to pilot during her training

(Boy and girl strongly dislike each other)

Pilot doesn’t want to train boy, but he forces him to. (Though girl doesn’t find out how until later)

One day boy almost kills girl, but feels conflicted by it. (A suggestion of mutual romantic feelings ensues)

That night Pilot tries to kill boy by setting his room on fire

Boy escapes. Leaves both girl and Pilot. Girl is confused and devastated. Pilot is suspiciously happy. 

Years go by. Girl goes to defeat leader of the bad guys. Finds out boy is son of leader. Angst and fighting ensues.

1162,stanleyandlarson,Advice,24,writing,1601824672,"How to NOT handle criticism (Story Time) Hi there,

I got the idea to write this after I saw a post on Twitter about a writer who received some feedback from a beta read and one of the readers decided to be personally offensive to the writer or “trolling” them. 

I used to roleplay back on MySpace 10+ years ago, it was great writing practice and I got to interact with other writers.   

Back on MySpace, users could post on a bulletin board that was accessible via the home page. I began to write with someone, I was enjoying the storyline and I was really impressed with the writing style of this other roleplayer. 

This certain roleplayer then decided to take pot shots at all of the writers they were interacting with, me included, referring to me as “dumb” during one of their bulletin posts. I don’t have dinosaur skin, being called dumb back then hurt. So in my teenage anger, I messaged the person asking them what the hell their problem was. 

In their glee, they explained that they were a full-time writer, successful in the field (selling novels galore) and because of this, they could write whatever they wanted about me (and others) in this certain way. 

I gave up talking to this person and a couple of weeks later, they came clean and posted on their bulletin again. It turned out that they weren’t a successful full-time writer after all, they were having a lot of issues in their home life and were having a hard time dealing with their work being rejected. They decided to use MySpace as a way of venting their anger and taking it out on other novices like myself. They then apologised for their behaviour. 

*What I learned from that experience when receiving criticism:*

\-You cannot control what others say in their review of your work. They will write what they wish, in whatever tone they like. 

\-It’s one person’s opinion. Take the feedback in critiques which is useful and beneficial to the project you’re working on. 

\-Don’t bother responding to negativity or trying to engage with trolls. If they are being purposely offensive, it’s to incite a reaction, or to make themselves look good or witty to others. Looking back at that moment on MySpace, I realised messaging the other roleplayer was actually giving them what they wanted: attention. 

\-Someone out there is going to hate your book. Writing is subjective. People have different tastes in books/genres. If a reader has *paid* to read your work, and they didn’t like it, they can say whatever they want about it. 

\-When someone gives me constructive feedback, I’ve always found it inspiring and encouraging. The fact that they have bothered to engage with my text and provide ideas on how to improve it is a wonderful, also you need constructive criticism in order to improve your writing. 

Right, that’s my story time done. I hope you enjoyed it, found it useful. “If it’s not useful to you,” as Anne Rice says, “throw it out the window.” :D 

Keep writing, keep creating.

Hope you’re all doing well and staying safe out there.

1187,CamperorLOL,Discussion,36,writing,1601799567,"Why do people dislike Traditional Heroes? Is there really any explanation why the conventional classical traditional hero is often seen as bad and looked down upon by others?

I mean, having limits mean strength in human society. But when a traditional hero is a warrior that doesn't kill his enemies, such as villains, they fight them nobly. Giving them a second chance and/or imprisonment by honest government officials.

But what's really strange is how modern entertainment tends to favor evil over justice/good instead. Which to me, is something I wish they could stop and focus on positive things for a change. Like the classical handsome hero motivated by lawful justice and is devoted to help anyone who has no one else by their side. They are ""Lawful Good"" and when they take their villains down, they often give them a second chance and/or let them be imprisoned for their crimes. Their stories are touching, romantic, classical, and while they can hurt themselves emotionally... They never give up the fight no matter what. They also view the world half-full on a glass of water.

Examples would be Superman (DC Comics), Spider-Man (Marvel Comics), Captain America (Marvel Comics), Apollo Justice (Ace Attorney), Kenshiro (Fist of the North Star), Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto), and Luke Skywalker (Star Wars).

But why is modern fiction viewers carry an attitude like this? Why do they favor Anti-Hero Protagonists over traditional hero protagonists? What makes them looked down upon compared to characters we know today? And what is the philosophy behind it?"

I'm prepared for it to come out pretty bad being my first attempt, but at least it's something I'd be very passionate to write about.


As for my idea, it has to do somewhat with the butterfly effect based on rejection. The book will look like a letter that I'm writing to a past love, that for nearly a decade, I couldn't get out of my mind, even after marrying someone else. 


Though I couldn't dedicate my full affection to my wife at first, I slowly learned a new meaning of love. After years of fabricating idealistic scenarios with my lost love, the reality was that my romantic journey with my own wife became more and more exceptional. We began spending every waking moment together, even working together. We traveled the world for two years experiencing the very out-of-the-ordinary, such as working on farms to get by, living with a cult, feeding pilgrims, sharing a near-death experience, etc. Then we continued to mature, had 3 loving children, and now it pains me to envision life any other way.


The first half of the book would reveal the true intense emotion I felt for my past love, the memories that haunted me, and the regrets I held for years. The second half would describe the redemptive journey I wouldn't have otherwise experienced had I not picked up the pieces of my life and taken the leap of faith.


This ""letter"" to my past love would serve a response to her attempts to contact me a few times years after she broke my heart. It would provide a candid outpouring of my emotion both past and present, as well as a final sense of closure, with no hard feelings attached.


I really have so much to say, and it's not so important that my book be a success so much as a therapeutic realization and expression. But instead of keeping it all to myself in the form of memoirs, I would like to get it out there somehow with the hopes of encouraging others who can relate."

1206,TheExtraPeel,Advice,0,writing,1609788355,"Enjoying Writing and finishing projects I like writing stories. Always have and I hope I always will. Last year, I started a book, planned it out and everything, but it seemed doomed from the start as I highly disliked it for the entirety of my writing it, but I was determined to finish it. Finally, I gave up because I disliked it too much. It was a fantasy. The world wasn’t fleshed out at all and I didn’t plan it well, likely because I hate planning and find I write better without it. I tried to stick to my plan too much, so now I’ve decided to write a space opera because I love Star Wars. I am opting this time to not nave a plan as my previous project was planned and that went awful: all other non-planned stories have always gone well and I have enjoyed writing them. A plan is too rigid and restrictive but also I feel the subgenre of space opera should also grant me more freedom. Obviously, Star Wars will be a big influence, though my ideas will be original (or as original as can be). So, my question is, should I continue with the original book (fantasy), or the space opera (I have written 1500 words unedited so far)?"

Writing has become so hard because my main source of inspiration, party stories and going out are...gone. Don't get me wrong I'm not a crazy party girl, but I liked going to a few carefully selected parties in my hometown with old friends from school. 

Cheap Thrills by Sia came on while I was rewriting my first draft and it made me just...sad. I really miss putting on makeup to go out and wonder who'll be there, too. I miss dancing with my girlfriends, catching up with people from school that I wouldn't normally see and coming home feeling inspired from the emotions, music, the dancing etc. I even kind of miss that empty feeling the next morning, scrolling threw instagram before taking a shower and all. I miss listening to my sister telling me all about what happened at her parties. And I definitely miss quite Saturday afternoons I spend writing, recalling the feeling and filling the pages with vivid party scenes that turn into a disaster.

My characters have nothing to do with people from my life/past but I wanted to create something that could've happened (even the murder isn't unrealistic or overly spectacular) and would've helped me when I was 16, slowly getting sucked into my hometowns party and drug scene. I wanted to create a big sister in book form because I didn't have one. Now, since our parties are gone, I feel the purpose I had fading into the background."

Wanted to write it. Still do. But the more I procrastinate and think, the more I'm started to get worked up over it. Especially since I'm still reading too obviously. I catch something new everytime I read a new book.

""Oh, need an actual decent map and should finalize my ""area of happening"" (my term for the area the story actually takes place in the map).

""Need more Believable names""

""Need to solidify my world building""

""It's a fantasy world with magic, there's no way there wouldn't be a religious system of sorts...need to think that through and make a WHOLE system of belief""

Stuff like that...that last one just came to me tonight, and so far it has me the most stressed, since it's the most...crucial? Like it has the means to be the most story and world changing, but since all this started at a whim, I have literally nothing set. 

Is there a version of this where ""on the top of my head"" still works? Or should I take a few weeks and just grudgingly actually build my world in a separate doc, and call back to it or even use it later?"
1221,Mr_Westerfield,Advice,5,writing,1609783589,"Breather Chapters I’m going through my story with a round of edits, and I’m hitting a bit of a structural issue. Namely, should I eliminate a “breather” chapter.

To explain, I wanted to have the story hit the ground running in the first two chapters. There’s quite a lot of action and rapid developments, but only a bit of context. So, to balance things out, I slowed things down with a bit of a breather in chapter 3, where the protagonist takes stock of things. The plot doesn’t progress (except at the very end). Instead the bulk of the time is spent with the character trying to work out why they are where they are, and where they go from there. Likewise, the aim of the chapter isn’t to provide character development, but rather give more of a snapshot of where they are mentally after the events of chapters 1-2.

The conventional wisdom is that you want to keep things moving. From that perspective, the chapter looks like a lot of fat that can be trimmed. And to be sure, I could spread out the different elements elsewhere. But “can” doesn’t mean “should,” and I’m wary of eliminating the chapter like that. First, because having a breather chapter would give the reader a chance to reorient themselves. And second, because it would allow for some reflection that there just isn’t room for in the hectic few chapters. It just doesn’t feel appropriate to relegate that to glancing references elsewhere. And while it’s usually better to drip, drip, drip details to the reader through more naturalistic means, sometimes it is better to just coherently lay out a situation in one go.

Now, instead of asking whether I should eliminate this chapter, which would probably require more information, I’d like to open up a discussion on the wisdom of using breather chapters in general. Breather/bottleneck episodes are common in television, of course, but there the consideration is usually more with time/budget issues, rather than pacing. With books, where you want to be economical with your word count, they’re much less common. But they certainly aren’t absent either. I’ve seen plenty of “breather” chapters elsewhere, where you’ll follow a character through their day or see them stuck at an impasse. They usually don’t have a lot in terms of new developments, but I do often enjoy them for the introspection and creative conceits they allow.

I don’t know, anyone have any thoughts on this?"

So instead of one of us trying to adapt to the other's style of creating (he's really not that great at writing novels LOL) we decided he'd write a script for each chapter and I would adapt it.

However, I am...having trouble, to say the least. Scripts are quite literally the barebones version of a story.

1229,Midwesternnerd,Other,31,writing,1609776693,"My New Years resolution: to write every day. For a good New Years resolution, specific goals are usually unhealthy. Saying “I will finish my novel by next year” is a great thing to aspire to, but if you’re anything like me, you’ll spend weeks on end trying to map out your plot, not having the motivation to write, yadda yadda. 

So this year, I’m taking a different approach: to do at least some creative writing every day. It could be a couple paragraphs, or it could be a couple pages.

Here are some of the benefits I’m already getting from this type of resolution:

- When I write one day, it gives me momentum to write the next day. 

- When I do my writing for the day, I get to check something off of my mental checklist (which is satisfying and gives me momentum to get other things done).

- Without standards of “X done by X time”, I’m not stressed about reaching a particular goal. I’m able to take it one day at a time, and not be trying to plan out months ahead. 

- You’d be surprised how quickly things add up. I’ve already written more than 1,100 words since the year started. That may not seem like a lot to some, but it’s quite a lot to me.

- I’m noticing that as days go on, I’m starting to accelerate in my writing. That is, I write more and more every time I do my daily writing. It could get to the point where I’m writing pages upon pages every day, though I’m not sure yet. 

So all in all, I recommend this strategy. Don’t worry about giving yourself deadlines or quotas. Don’t worry about mapping or planning. Remember that you can always come back to edit it later, and all that really matters is progress."

I feel as though I’ve finally (finally!) rounded a corner with my manuscript. I’m about ~5k words from my initial word count goal.

When I say strategic fights I don’t mean medieval battles or military tactics. I mean more along the lines of jojos bizarre  adventure, death note, talentless nana, kaiji ultimate survivor and Hunter x Hunter (to name a few).

They always seem to be small scale battles of the mind more than physical. usually taking place between 2 opponents who have to outsmart each other in a way that the reader never saw coming but still feels satisfying and believable. 

Usually each character has some kind of superpower that the opponent will try to analyse and find a clever counterattack, alternatively there is some kind of situation usually a game where figuring out a way to bend the rules of the game to your advantage ensures victory. In either case there are always rules  in place that allow the characters to structure their strategy around.

I'm writing a short story inspired by a recent (but resolved) murder.  It's just for my eyes and not for publishing (at least not anytime soon), but it made me wonder about the ethics of writing fiction based on or inspired by true crime.  A cursory Google search gives lots of how-tos for writing true crime and some editorial pieces about the ethics of it  but they refer mostly to documentaries and dramas portraying what actually happened.  A reddit search yielded a post in r/screenwriting that got two replies, and couple of others (below), but equally focused on the ""true"" aspect, aka, portraying actual events.  

What should you consider if you want to approach *fiction* *inspired by*  a real-life murder/er?  Obviously if it's very distanced from the original crime (like a serial killer loosely inspired by Ed Gein with a bit of Son of Sam thrown in but set in a fantasy world), that's different.  

But what if there's a specific element that makes your fiction easily linked to the real crime (like, cannibalism and celebrity for Issei Sagawa, or a murdering doctor who attempts to forge a victim's will like Harold Shipman)?  How do you approach this ethically without being exploitative or being disrespectful to those close to the victim(s)--especially if you're writing horror?  Is it possible?  How did Jack Ketchum do with *The Girl Next Door*?  

Really interested to hear opinions.

1267,LightbulbHD,Advice,3,writing,1609742372,"How Do I Write a HAPA Character Who Struggles With Their Identity? I have an Isekai story in mind that involves the main character having an internal struggle of who they are and a touch of self-racism in them. To make it clearer, some background: My MC is half American and half Japanese, his American father left him at a very young age and the MC was left to be raised by his mother in a predominantly white neighborhood. The story takes place around the early 2000s so you can figure my MC would suffer from racial discrimination from an early age until his mid-teens, and this racism he experienced causes him to hate his Asian heritage and without a father figure to help support him, this also causes him to be more underconfident and etc.

So the story takes place with him moving to Japan with his mother at the age of 16, his mother suffers from a minor mental condition which causes her to ignore her son and spend most of the day sulking and working, which was one of the reasons why they moved back to Japan. And the story goes with him struggling to find an identity for himself and gain some confidence as he is killed and Isekaid into a world dominated by multiple species that all look down on him. The plot revolves around an interstellar Isekai where each planet participates in a yearly competition held by the God of the universe, apparently all the alien races know of Humans and laugh at how pathetic and weak they are, considering they were originally a joke creation by the God of Earth. And obviously, this doesn't help with the MC's self racism and lack of confidence.

Now, not being a mixed person myself, I have no idea how to write a compelling and realistic HAPA character. I don't want to just point out to the readers on the first chapter that he hates his own race, I want to hint to the readers on the first chapter that he hates his own race, but I don't know how (Still a newbie writer) to introduce it without revealing too much. So to any HAPA or mixed heritage writers here on reddit, if you have some sort of self-racism, what is it like? Does it effect your mental health and everyday life? How do you cope? Tips from any writers and not exclusive only to mixed people are also appreciated. And also any tips on how to write racist aliens would be much appreciated and how can I have my MC react to this.

My question is, would it be feasible or worthwhile to create a sort of mega-universe? Think Riordanverse or the Cosmere or MCU even. 

For me, the pros of this is that I get to unleash creativity in a new and different way and create something super grand to tie it all together. I also have ideas that would easily explain a so-called 'multiverse.'

The cons of this are that it will be HARD. Keeping a single series straight can be difficult but I'm no Brandon Sanderson and I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. It would also mean that I should come up with an overarching nemesis or plot to hint at through the basic stories so readers won't be blindsided for the finale.

The worlds I'm considering 'combining' are a world with elemental magic, primordial gods, oracles, and fantasy creatures. The other one is more sci-fi thriller than fantasy and the main ability is the ability to phase, or break down the walls separating dimensions and move objects and people through space and dimensions. The second one is somewhat Lovecraftian and much scarier than the first.

1281,FrankNix, ,86,writing,1609730628,"Exercises in Futility— Self-Publishing in Today’s World of Online Scams (Taken from my blog which I won't link here so it's not removed. If you want to request it in the comments, I'll post it). 

As a self-published author, I can’t help but feel like the deck is stacked against me. Have you experienced this? It feels like the system is rigged for the little guy to fail. The last few weeks have been like a lot of 2020—fulfilling, but intensely frustrating. Lately, the frustration has overtaken any other emotion, leading mostly to a sense of failure, anger and depression. 

If you’re an author, self-published or otherwise, please read the following and let it serve as a warning to you. 

So, what is all this frustration about? I guess it starts with when my book, Timberwolves, was first published. That was a happy moment because I’d achieved one of my major goals, but then the reality set in. Sales were nowhere near my expectation. I paid to run ads on Amazon. They ran (and continue to)—and while they’ve generated a few clicks, they’ve resulted in ZERO sales. I couldn’t even find people to review it properly. So, you can understand my excitement when I was contacted by someone through Good Reads who offered an honest review in exchange for a copy of the book. I felt like this was agreeable and fair, so I agreed. She then said that for a cost, she would feature my book on her Youtube page and make a review video. It seemed a little time consuming, and work was involved to create the video, so I agreed to pay her. As soon as the money was sent, she blocked me on Good Reads and Twitter, and I learned the hard way that this was all a scam, apparently. (As an aid to other authors, this scammer goes by **Fantasyryus** on Good Reads and **Syryus8** on Twitter—avoid her). 

Sales started to trickle in, and I got one review, 5-Stars, which was amazing and you could tell the reviewer actually read the book. It was intensely gratifying to read and know that someone had enjoyed what I created. I tried to spread word about the book. I went to Reddit, and created an AMA (Ask Me Anything) where people can come in and ask questions. Some people were participating, and it was fun to connect with people who were interested in my work. Then, like a child crushing ants with their thumbs, the Reddit AMA moderators shut down the thread and deleted it because, in a nutshell, I wasn’t “famous enough.” The irony wasn’t lost on me (but it is apparently on them), that by deleting the thread they are limiting my exposure and how ""famous” I could be. So that was a major frustration. 

I continued tweeting things on Twitter as I have for several years, and even though I have 1500 or so followers, I regularly only get one or two interactions per tweet—sometimes less. It feels like I’m just micro-journaling to myself, and like the title of this post, it feels like an exercise in futility. A fellow writer suggested that I might have more luck on Facebook, so I heeded the advice and created an account. 

At first, I was amazed. I was gaining “friends” quickly and many of my posts, whether about art or literature were met with around 20 interactions. (Although, it’s probably telling that the post with the most interactions—about 3 times as much as the others— was a New Year’s Harambe meme). 

I joined several writing groups on Facebook and began friending the others in the groups. Anyway, this is where the trouble began. I created an innocent enough post (I thought) with links to my book on Amazon, my blog, and my art page of my website. I paid Facebook to promote the post, just to get me some more exposure in the writing community. Facebook denied the ad because their algorithm thought I was trying to scam people or something (irony again, I know). But Facebook sent me an email claiming that after some investigating, they found that my ad was blocked in error (duh!) and I could promote the post once again. I went and tried, but it didn’t work. In fact, on everything that I posted on Facebook was a little button that told me I wasn’t able to promote anything because that function of my account was still disabled because of violations.

Oh well, no biggie, right? In the meanwhile, I continued adding friends. Did I know each person I added? No, but I don’t think this is uncommon. I was adding people in the groups I was in—people with similar interests and tastes, and friends of those friends. I believe this is a fairly common practice. In a few weeks, I had about 2,000 Facebook friends, and to my delight about 600 of those had followed and liked my dedicated author page—Frank Nix-Author and Artist. Things were going about as well as a self-published, hardworking author could hope.  I discovered that I could create an online Facebook store, so I did, spending a few days creating a replica of what can be found at www.franknix.com/art where people can browse and purchase prints of my digital art, and that store was in the review process. 

Then, Facebook decided not only to disable my account, but they also deleted my author and artist fan page. WHAT!? After working hard to build that network, and finding a smidgeon of success, they just swooped in and stole it away. Since they did so, according to my website analytics, my page views has dropped from about 60+ per day to around 5. Obviously this is affecting my exposure, and therefore, my business. They emailed me and said that their algorithm thought I was bot, (which I’m clearly not). They requested that I record a video message of my face, which I did. Ok, I took a nervous breath and assumed all would be restored properly after they saw that I was, in fact, not a robot. However, the next time I tried to log-in, all evidence of my account seems to have disappeared. The link I had to that fan page at the top of frankix.com is now a broken link. I’ve messaged them on email and on Twitter, and have heard zero response. After a few days, I began to get desperate, and desperation breeds stupidity. 

So what stupid thing did I do? I sent another scammer some money. A while back when my account was first disabled, a few people contacted me (I assume they’re all part of the same scamming network) and suggested I give this guy a try on Twitter— **CyberAGOfficial**. He claimed, and others backed him up, that he could restore my Facebook account. There were “screen capped” testimonials, which I assume now were all fabricated by him, of all the others he’s helped in the past. Anyway, long story short, he promised he could get it done, and if he couldn’t, the amount would be refunded. As soon as the money was sent, he then claimed he needed more to buy more tools. That’s when I knew something was up. He then blocked me on social media, and once again, I was scammed and had to learn the hard way. 

I’m angry at both **CyberAGOfficial** and **Syryus8** for scamming me, but I honestly get it. They’re doing what they can to hustle in this system that’s been created by these huge corporations like Facebook and Reddit, not too different from how self-published authors have to try to hustle for every little click or like they can muster.  A huge part of me just wants to scream…

 **FUCK FACEBOOK! FUCK REDDIT!** 

…from the mountaintops. I feel depressed that these people are able to take advantage of others so easily, while at the same time, my account is deleted because it’s assumed I’m trying to scam people just because I want to share something with them that I’ve worked on for a decade. Writing community, what can we do to change the system, where hard-working authors don’t have to rely on hackers, scammers, or luck to make it in today’s publishing climate?

Let this be a warning to you, so you don’t make the same rookie mistakes I made during these early days of my novel publication. And if you know anyone who actually works at Facebook, please tell them to contact me on Twitter @ FrankNix or message me here so we can remedy this horrible situation. 

Oh, and I get the irony (lots of that going around, huh?) of me screaming this into the void where likely one or two people at most may ever see this. Ugh. Is 2021 over yet?

In the past couple years that I've fully realized, strengthened, and developed my writing abilities, I have found that I have become too self-reliant on fulfilling my own creative health; and while I am immensely proud of the progress I have made to finding my own voice and artistry, I am also worried that during this process, I have created a mental barrier that prevents me from getting too excited over other people's work. 

Basically, I have numbed an ability to be thrilled, deeply moved, and enthusiastic about any creative work that is not my own. It sounds, and is, pathetic, but I'm **too afraid to fall in love with someone else's character because then I will want to take them myself**. Analyzing, developing, and creating characters is one of my eternal joys, and I used to do it all the time with my favorite fictional characters. I would do studies with tv shows, movies, books, etc, which made me enjoy whatever content I was interacting with more. (It also led me to short-lived adventures in fan-fiction, because I got to release all of my original ideas and thoughts about the characters, but I see now how this has affected my perspective on enjoying a story.)

This is all part of the appeal of fantasy and storytelling in general though- we all imagine what it would be like to be the characters, how we would react in their situations, how we would explore their worlds- so why should I want to expend mental energy and passionate love over a character if I cannot create anything with them? This thinking is selfish, I know, but it prevents me from loving anything too hard **because then I feel like I can never be truly one with it.** I must learn to find a way to still become deeply attached to a story and not want to completely engulf it. 

One last thing to mention- I am bipolar, and my depression can greatly affect how passionate I am about something, and also just how much energy I have to be creative in general. I am on medication but have been dealing with this creative problem for 1 1/2 years now."

I'm replaying the Uncharted games for inspiration, and I'm realising that the clues don't really make much sense. For example, the protagonist randomly finds a missing page from a journal, which tells him the city which the treasure was moved to. But why was the missing page there? Why would the previous treasure hunter leave clues lying around? Is this acceptable in this genre? I'm asking because I am finding it hard to write a treasure hunt story that makes sense. Wouldn't previous treasure hunters just destroy all clues? Why would they love any behind?"

He has been under bad conditions for the longest of time and is being (long story short) held against his will. And against his will he is being used to kill people again and again.

He is so accustomed to the concept of death and he has pretty much abandoned any past sense of empathy for anyone of anything. He isn’t a bad person but he simply isn’t able to read the room or tell how anyone is actually feeling. He just feels very detached and has gone emotionally numb.

If you're not familiar with it, I'll be more than happy to fill in the blanks :) if you're already familiar with the game, you'll know who I'm talking about ;) here's a summary for a non league fan perspective.

My story is about a girl who migrates from her birthplace at 15 years old, a region known of its technological advances but also for its streams of toxic runoffs and decorator government, to a more peaceful region known for its calm and magical forests, seeking a more peaceful life.

She immediately falls in love with the land and although the town she arrived in was a slum, she still decides to stay, working a day's shift in an inn in exchange of staying rent free. In order to provide pocket money, she takes up street fights and dominates thanks to the skills she learned during her rough life in the first region.

One day she finds herself forced to be roommates with another street fighter her age, and although they got on each other's nerves perfectly and often played (not so pleasant) pranks at one another, they got along in the long run and fell in love, finding an escape from their unkind pasts and lives in one another's arms. Though it wasn't the outloud kinda love, it was more the ""you tell anyone about this and I'll murder you in your sleep"" kinda thing. The sweet teenage years.

Then war happens and fast forwarding, she finds out that the enemy is using technology from her homeland (toxic gaz bombs, chemical weaponry etc) and it ignites her will to fight. She loves her current home and would not allow its natural beauty and clean air to be subjected to such violence. She decides to leave for the war with a couple of friends from the inn. Her lover, his ego not allowing him to admit his feelings first and beg her to stay, lets her go, convincing himself it was just an affair and nothing more, though he did feel the hurt nonetheless.

After the war, she becomes a boss who leads a two faced all-girl mafia in with a considerable amount of power. They work as both protectors of the land but still also engage in illicit activities and politics undercover (to keep track of what happens and what not); keeping the smiles for the innocent and their teeth for the tyrant. Ravaged by the war's horrors and her lonely past, she develops an alienation complex that she struggles with as the plot goes.

Her ex lover also rose to prominence though not in the honourable way she did. He becomes the boss of his own fighting pit (sort of like MMA but illegal), the region's biggest enterprise for gambling and vice. He becomes that rich badass playa whom every gal swoons over, arrogant, bossy, and overconfident. To him as long as he gets rich and brings comforts to his single mother, nothing else in the world matters, including how he gets rich and who dies in the process. This of course is a result of the rough life he had.

The heroine on the other hand knows about his business, though she turns a blind eye to it because it's most criminals' and outlaws' destination (including the influencial), and instead of locking the pit down, she sends her spies in there for infiltration, to keep track of who comes and goes.

Eventually they meet again and, faced with their now opposite goals and personalities, go through a heartbreaking dilemma of push and pull caused by their lingering feelings for one another, that ends up in a redemption arc for both of them.

Without getting too much into details (YES, MUCH MORE details exist), it's It's a slow burn romance/comedy with of course the juicy 18+ bits, alternating between the guy's and the girl's POV.

In the prologue, my original plan was to have a character (a novice sailor) be witness of a supernatural event. This event’s consequences will be the trigger for the main story to start. The sailor will be the only survivor of the disappearance of an entire fleet of ships. But the entire prologue will be told from his POV, so there would be a lot of weird things happening with no explanation to set up the mystery of what happened to the fleet. This would be one of those loose ends that would not tie themselves at the end of the first book.

My idea was to make this kinda like an “ice monster prologue” similar to the one in George R. R. Martin’s A Game of thrones. To make sure the readers know there is latent mysterious fantasy element in a world with no magic, and also most of the story will be focused on political intrigue and non-supernatural mystery, with little “fantastical” element at first.

This character would return later in the story but from another character’s POV, so the resolution of what he lived wouldn’t be as thorough as if we’d seen it through his eyes.

So far I’ve almost finished writing said prologue and I’m over 7K words. My worry is: am I making the prologue too elaborate? Will the readers get latched on to this character only to be disillusioned when they find out there will be little focus on him for the rest of the story?"

1351,TeaFaceGuy,Advice,18,writing,1603404802,"How Stealing Will Make You a Better, More Confident Writer Parents, teachers, and even God himself have all told us: Don’t steal!

Alternative: steal from the right people, and only what is useful.

Many creative minds are plagued by the notion that their work must be ‘original’ and ‘unique’ to be valuable. This idea is a trap, it ensnares you in a kind of performance anxiety, and it ought to be debunked, burned and buried.

Once you unburden yourself from the pressure of being original and learn how to steal, you will be doing yourself — and the maybe even the world — a big favour. Scrap that part of the equation and focus on getting results.

We rarely hear about people outside of creative fields complaining about lacking originality. Scientists, for example, are not concerned about the originality of their studies, but whether or not their contributions have inched humanity closer to a more complete picture of the truth. Science is built on foundational principles that have been developed and fine-tuned over the last few centuries, and modern scientists operate within that framework.

Similarly, writing is both a science and an art. We’ve got history and research that tell us what works and what doesn’t, what the brain likes and what it ignores, and this understanding allows us to make better predictions.

In short, what I’m proposing is nothing illegal or outlandish. It’s not plagiarism, nor is it a dismissal of individuality, but a mere statement of fact: there is no need for us to re-invent the wheel.

# It Starts With Psychology

‘I have never in my life attempted to compose anything original.”

— Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

Do you know why modern pop music, as vile and uninspiring as it is, manages to be so commercially successful year-to-year?

Because they rely on human psychology to guarantee a constant stream of cash. There is no guessing in the music industry. They’ve run the tests, done the studies, and they know exactly what will bring in the sweet cash.

Majority of the songs that line the top charts today use the same few chord progressions to create a sense of familiarity with the masses. Familiarity begets comfort, and although the brain loves novelty, it appreciates order and safety above anything else.

Creativity, on the other hand, is unpredictable and chaotic. It may work, it may flop, it may alienate a portion of your target audience, and as such creativity is not a viable business model for the music industry.

In understanding this, the big challenge is to present old things in new ways, by identifying and understanding the patterns that make a good piece of writing work.

For example, the most common pattern in fiction is that of the hero’s journey; in advertising, it’s understanding things like product placement and how to capture people’s attention; and blogs tend to rely on short and easily digestible structuring to appeal to our internet-fried attention spans.

In essence, although our cultural norms change with time, the human brain remains the same. What worked generations ago is what still works today, albeit the mediums are more evolved.

# Steal Like a Pro

“Good artists copy, great artists steal.”

— Pablo Picasso

‘Pastiche’ is a French term that refers to a work of art — film, novel, painting — that imitates multiple other sources and layers them up to create something fresh.

Quentin Tarrantino’s films are a notorious example of this astoundingly lucrative style. He never went to school to study film-making but was self-educated during his younger days while working as a movie clerk in a video store. He watched anything and everything available to him, and thus became known for having an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of film. He once said in an interview, ‘I steal from every single movie ever made.’

Pretty bold.

To launch your career as a bona fide thief, begin by writing out, word for word, your favourite passages from the works that you admire. This is an old practice known as copywork.

Copywork is best practised with pen and paper because as you write by hand, your brain picks up more of the stylistic nuances and structural features of the composition. It is said that God is in the details, and regular copywork exercises grant access to the mind of the creator.

Go ahead, pick up a classic, something that has withstood the test of time. Ernest Hemingway would be a good start — he is known for his short and punchy sentences. H.P. Lovecraft makes another good suggestion: ‘An excellent habit to cultivate is the analytical study of the King James Bible. For simple yet rich and forceful English, this masterly production is hard to equal.’

To steal well, examine the works of the masters, read between the lines, and strive to reinterpret it with your flavour. This way you will derive the essence of the work and, in time, contribute something worthwhile to the craft as a whole.

Stealing from the masters is not something to be frowned upon. Their success speaks for itself and should be reason enough for us to imitate their methods. After all, they understood the value of stealing.

# Innovate Like a Mad Man!

“If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

— Isaac Newton

What some call genius, others call hard work.

If it were easy, everyone would be a damn superstar, but it’s not supposed to come easy. We need to earn it every single day, and that is the most humbling experience.

It is written in the Hindu scriptures that man is entitled to the labour, but not the fruit of his labour. In other words, our capacity for doing good work is what defines us in the long-term, not what we get out of it. Rewards may come, but what matters most is character and dedication.

But there is also a method to the madness, and it is this: work hard, show up, immerse yourself in it, until, one day, an apple falls from a tree and hits you on the head.

BOOM!

A world-changing revelation strikes you.

There’s no other way. You must love what you do and do it consistently for the apple to fall.

Don’t wait for inspiration, don’t try to be original, don’t waste time re-inventing the wheel.

Hard work pays off. Optimism is our best friend."

1356,SharkBaitWasTaken,Advice,9,writing,1603400409,"When to be descriptive? I hope this isn't too general, but when should I describe the environment and/or the scene. How often should I focus on the details? Every time the protagonist moves between rooms, or every time I plan on having them stay there for a while? Also, when should I describe sort of 'past events'

For example, I tried writing a rough chapter. It begins with the protagonist laying in the snow, after falling from a 2nd floor window. I mention that it's cold, and that there's a lot of wind. I spent approximately 5 sentences on this entire scene. Then, I move to an office, where the protagonist is being reprimanded. I briefly describe the office (Emphasis on briefly), and mostly focus on the argument between the woman and the protagonist. There's a point where the woman mentions the protagonist stealing cigarettes, and I follow that by describing that she gets them from the other women who hide them in plain sight (This is what I meant by 'past events').

Altogether, I'm generally unsure of when to be descriptive and when to be brief. I've heard a lot about info-dumping in the first few chapters, and I try to avoid that. There's also the show, don't tell aspect, that I can often get lost in. 

Would anybody have any tips or advice?"

CONTEXT: Basically I have this character and the main thing about him  is that he creates potions, and that he has a very bad addiction to drinking love potions. (To which basically makes him incredibly horny and how he describes it “better than sex”)

But this really fucks up his emotions, making him have a lot of mood swings, not understanding how he really feels, feeling insecure about himself etc.....

And one of the things that he struggle  with is his sexuality. Before he became addicted he was straight, but when taking this potion his attraction to other people goes hey wire, making him not real having a. preference on who he sleeps with.

So I wanted to do a scene where he wakes up (potion effects gone) and notices a guy  sleeping next to him. Soon realising that he slept with a man, it makes him run to the toilet to throw up due shock and panic.

Tho idk If that would be to much of an  exaggeration?? I actually personally identify as asexual and Havnt really had a ‘real’ attraction to either gender. So idk how if would feel like to some day realised you slept with the gender you weren’t attached to. 

What are your thoughts on this??

Eventually, another pashion came up.  
 I   have had/am having  some pretty happy teen years. I had a lot of parties, played a lot of sports... Anyhow, a pretty cliche adolescence. But I also went through a lot of stuff and, looking back, I think I was pretty depressed for a while. 

I know this sounds silly, but TV actually was something really meaningfull at the time. For a few hours a day, I was watching some show I liked, instead of overthinking stuff. Since then, I deeply appreciate tv shows. 

For the past few months, specially during quarentine, I started studying storytelling/scritps structure, and I finally wrote some scripts myself. I wrote a pilot and a couple of shortfilms, and honestly.... I LOVED to do it. It just feels so right... I really think TV writting is the perfect carreer for me. It kind of scares me, because I guess I never had an actual -dream- before.  
 The thing is: there are f'ing ENDLESS obstacles.

The main one is: I live in Brazil. Yeah, I know. That implicates in a thousand other issues.

The most obvious one is: we don't have a solid entratainment industry. We basically don't make tv shows. TV writting is just.... not a thing. There are only 15 successfull writters in Brazil, because there are literally 5 brazillian shows on tv. So, to work on TV, I'd have to move to America.

That brings a couple more problems:

1. I would have to write in english.  
\- That would be a challenge, but, as you can see, that's something I could eventually overcome

2. The true dealbreaker is: I don't have the money. At all. lol. If I had the chance to fly to LA, I would definelly be homeless. But even if I had the opportunity... Am I even good enough? Could I EVER be good enough?

Anyway.... Why am I special? I guess I'll just give up on my dreams and work with something I hate, like everybody else  


I could use some comfort words, though. I feel extremely powerless regard my future and that's awfull.  
 Excuse my english."

I’m in the early brainstorming stages of a book where my main characters are based off of the seven deadly sins. I’ve mapped out all the characters but I was conflicted with the ‘lust’ one because I have two separate ideas for them..

The first was having the character be raised in an environment that makes sex so much more then it is. Like maybe being raised around a brothel or something similar, being taught that they’re not worth much other then their body...

The second idea was that they were raised in a more religious environment that vilifies sex, so  ‘lust’ ,who wants to break away, uses sex as a way to show that they are not divine... if that makes sense..

So if someone could help me with which one sounds better/makes more sense that would be great.. or even if you have another idea as well, I’m open for suggestions!!

I also haven’t chosen what gender to make this character. At first I wanted to make them male to break away from the over-sexualized women trope, but then I played around with the idea of making them non-binary... so ya,.. opinions on that too would be great...

But when I look up the topic of changing your IRL personality, most people are under the impression that changing your personality is something that is very hard to do if not impossible; that your childhood experiences and subconscious have basically set it in stone.

But then again, our day-to-day experiences aren't exactly as traumatic or breathtaking as what most characters in stories go through, so that could be a possible reason for the discrepancy.

I'm not a writer myself, but read, listen to, and watch the work of writers and there is something that has interested me for years that I haven't been able to find a meaningful discussion on. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

When writing fiction set in The Real World how on earth do y'all determine what, exactly, can and can't be made up? For example, in The West Wing, a show clearly designed to be in 'the real world':

* There are numerous previous recent presidents that are made up
* There is an entire middle eastern country that is made up (Qumar)

Neither of these things demand explanation, nor convince me that I'm in an ""alternate"" world.  However, let's say that

* The show established that Steve Smith was the first President of US
* The President's secretary popped her head in the office and nonchalantly said ""Mr. President, I have the governor of West Nebraska on the line for you""

I would suddenly feel as though I was watching a show in some parallel universe, especially in the case of West Nebraska.  

I'm interested in current thoughts on the topic, but also how it's changed over time (Victor Hugo, for example, would reference real people but obscure their names ""Cardinal R-----"") so if this is a topic that somebody has lots of thoughts about but nobody has ever wanted to listen to you rant about it I'm a very eager listener!"

1420,Diogenes_1391, ,2,writing,1608229909,"Getting over it: A day in the life after a break-up  

The day started with the usual routine, wave after wave of thoughts entered my mind. ""Is she okay? what must she be thinking about? does she miss me?"" I had to force myself back to reality, lest I spend my day like the previous two, stuck in a loop. I decided to lay in bed, trying to close my eyes, hoping to prolong my dreamless sleep. As I looked at the clock it showed I was running behind on my timetable by almost an hour. Yet, after the brief hiatus, I didn't feel compelled to rush back into a routine. No one is waiting for you, I reminded myself. 

When the brain keeps circling on the same set of thoughts ad nauseam, reality starts to feel so disconnected. I struggled to get out of bed and into the loo to start the daily routine I had so enthusiastically planned for myself. The exercise session was stimulating, and I found myself focussing only on completing the set. It's official, exercise is probably the best mood stabilizer out there. A pity then, that even this tidbit was something she used to mention. Its almost as if the universe is conspiring to remind me of her at all points in time. 

Nonetheless, I trudged on with my day, with a cab ride spent practising german. Why am I learning german? I started learning Bengali and german, hoping to impress her with my elementary progress. I have tried picking up Bengali before but have never been able to make serious progress. With German, however, I was using Duolingo and hence expected it to manifest as something more than just one or two phrases. As on today, the chance that I might speak to her again seems to tend towards zero. She tells me that if we are meant to be then it will happen, but this thought is in contradiction to the reason why we broke up in the first place. Didn't we fall apart because I didn't value you enough? Wasn't it a bone of contention that the relationship wasn't growing, that I wasn't growing?

Though a little late in the day, the realization that relationships don't just ""happen"" or stay strong without serious effort is something that I have hard-wired in me. The comforting words that she tells me are beautiful lies. I would love nothing more than to believe her, but I know without her wanting to, there is no way that this relationship stands a chance. Hope, such a double-edged sword! A long day ensues, I try to keep busy with my work to avoid the thoughts from creeping back in, I mostly succeed. A long meeting with some bank officials offers a brief relief as well. However, towards the end, I am again thinking of her. 

I reach home, clear a few pending tasks before continuing with the schedule I had planned. Somehow, evenings and nights prove to be the hardest and tonight feels no different. As the clock strikes twelve, I shall lie down and hope to fall asleep, I haven't been able to sleep before three since the past two days but remain hopeful that tonight might be different. Before going to sleep, I will send you a small prayer, ""I hope you have a beautiful night, a comforting sleep and a great day ahead.""

Good night."

Reading On Writing by Steven Kino.

I would love it if the replies could be from people who use writingcirclejerk or bookscirclejerk, which due to their nature and ban-happy mods I cannot ask directly. With that out of the way...

I'm planning a short story in which yellow would be used as a colour motif to symbolize control, or rather, loss of independence, ie, being trapped in an abusive relationship. However, the story is mostly concerned (page-time wise) with supernatural occurrences, and is therefore not a truly good book, or, at least, not in a truly worthwhile genre. 

(Name a single classic and well-praised book with explicitly magical happenings. No, the works of Bradno Sadno and Miku are not classically praised, no, Christmas carol isn't, no, Lord of the Flies isn't explicit, we could be here all day.) 

What should I do? The story doesn't really work without the supernatural horror elements, but I feel it would be a disgrace to good authors such as Fitzgerald (yes, he did. Look, if someone is so concerned about detail as to color their curtains, and their work is considered worthy of study and teaching, the blue probably means something.) to use such an idea in a stupid kids genre.

Then I realised that at 66,000 it was too short, but also got quite boring and improbable in parts where ideally it was the MC’s perspective that was needed. 

However, the MC’s childhood needs to be explained and so I had this idea:

- An angel-like figure gives the bones to the book and is the narrator throughout, this is the third person omniscient. However,

- Bits of the book the character is writing are included, since they are still an important part of the story. 

- The bulk of the book is from the MC’s first person, present tense perspective. 

I can’t work out how to structure this in a way that isn’t confusing, since it would be most useful if the omniscient narrator could interject within the MC’s narrative, but I don’t want I’m not sure how to ensure that doesn’t get muddled?

1442,user107858171, ,7,writing,1608217337,"Advice for most of the posts I see on this subreddit Most of the posts I see in this subreddit follow the same lines. Worrying about being original, worrying about offending someone, worrying that they are writing the same thing as someone else but not as good, worrying about all this and wondering if they should even try. 

You're so worried about how others will feel about your writing, that you're not even writing.

My father only ever gave me one line of advice, and as much as it pissed me off to hear, as an adult it's the best advice for me to apply to almost anything.

GET. OVER. IT.

Not everyone is going to like what you write. Some will even hate it. You're going to offend someone. Your idea, just like all others, has been done before. Your idea has been done better before. Your writing is going to be shit. 

I got it, how good a literary work is is decided by the crowd. But you can't worry about that. If the crowd says it's shit, don't worry about it. Just do it better next time. Crops can grow in a pile of shit, they can't grow in nothing. And if someone is offended, so be it. 

It's about 9:45 EST at the time of me posting this. If you were about to post something along the lines above, here's your fix:

1: Block off some time today to write something. Set a time/word limit or minimum. Whatever works for you.

2: Write whatever you want. Whether you rewrite See Spot Run or something completely original, just write it. Let the story happen.

3: Write WHATEVER YOU WANT! If you want to write a slur, do it. You want to write something unnecessarily offensive, dumb, or cliche, just do it. (Insert Shia Le-whatever gif) It's YOUR story. No one else's.

4: Don't look back. Whatever word, phrase, description you put down. Leave it there and write on. Write forward until you reach your limit.

5: Once your limit is done, put it away. Don't edit, don't read it, don't even breathe on it. Put it away for the rest of the day.

6: TOMORROW, pick it back up. Continue the above steps until the story, the beginning, middle, and end are written. If you want to jump around between your beginning, middle, and end that's fine, but get it written before you even read it. 

7: When you have the story written, wait a day, and read it. Edit it, rewrite it, change the whole damn thing if you want. Maybe you find that you didn't write the whole story the first time, maybe in your rewriting you change the entire story from the ground up, that's fine. You're working the field.

8: Get a third party to look at it and GRACIOUSLY receive feedback. Adjust as necessary. This subreddit has a sticky for posting your work for critique. Use it. Ask for advice on more specific things if you need it.

9: Submit it. Even if you're not happy with it. You'll never be happy with it. Stephen King THREW CARRIE IN HIS TRASH he was so unhappy with it. His wife found it and made him submit it. Let the court of public opinion decide.

10: Repeat."

I've looked everywhere in movies and shows specifically and I've never seen or read a better written redemption arc than the one Zuko has in the show Avatar: The last airbender.

It's a really tidy arc that spans the whole show and follows the perfext steps in how a redemption arc should be resolved.

As for why zuko's arc is the best:

**Zuko’s arc**

• **Act One:** Mindlessly trying to capture the Avatar to restore his honor and to please his father = *driven by his flaw (Season One)*.

• **Act Two:** Becomes an exiled and becomes aware of the suffering caused by Fire Nation - *questions himself for the first time (Beginning of Season Two)*.

• **Act Three:** Chooses to free Appa and to live a peaceful life with Iroh - *overcomes flaw for the first time (Middle of Season Two)*.

• **Act Four:** Chooses to side with Azula - *regresses to old self (End of Season Two)*.

• **Act Five:** Chooses to join Aang and to step up to his father - *kills old self, achieves balance*.

**Rubber Duck:** the Agni Kai against his father -*the moment he becomes flawed*.

**Tangible Objective:** To capture the Avatar.

**What he wants:** To restore his honor to his father.

**What he really needs:** To confront his abusive father and defend his own definition of honor.

Zuko is the poster boy for character arcs. His journey is perfectly crafted.  
There is so much more I could add about his arc from his parralel to characters liek Azula as well as other veryinteresting details with his relationship to other characters and his power level being inherent to his identity as a person.

Even looking at the best ones in films and tv and they never feel as great as this one.

It was nearly 7pm in the evening, and Anastasia still hadn't found a good book to read for the night. The clerks at the old Salvation Army Store in Wan Chai were already locking up the doors and preparing to close the shop down. Tracing her fingers across the spines of the books on the shelf, Anastasia closed her eyes and pulled out a random cover. “Surprise me,” she thought in her head. She had pulled out an old velvet diary, it looked very old and ratchet, almost as if it had been through hell. The pages were worn down, and the spine was torn apart, the glue barely strong enough to hold the pages together. Despite this, she quickly ran to the counter and checked the book out.

“This better be worth the money.” She told herself.

After a short and uneventful dinner with her family, Anastasia headed back into her room where she unpacked her bag. Reaching deep into her bag she pulls out her newfound book, the velvet cover glistening under her bedroom light. The title read “Diary C”.

“Diary C? I wonder who wrote you.” she thought to herself.

“I better take a look.”

*07/03/2019,*

*Dear Diary, I always thought I had thick skin, until today when you left us. I realised how much I wanted to melt and live within the grooves of your hands, so I could be a part of everything you touch…*

*\~A*

“Oh wow, same day as Julian died, poor girl.” She thought to herself, remembering the times she spent with her deceased ex boyfriend. It had been nearly a year since he had passed, however she still missed him more than ever.

*07/06/2019*

*Dear Diary , I still can’t believe you're gone. It’s been 3 days since you left us, and I’ve been feeling numb ever since. Mom let me off school for the past few days, and I've just been at home laying in bed trying to wake up from this nightmare. Please come back. You are my everything.*

*\~A*

*08/01/2019*

*Hi, it's been a month since i’ve written in this book. Things have been pretty bad lately, nothing seems to be going my way. Everything is being taken from me.*

*\~A*

“Wow, I never thought I could relate to someone more. I wish I knew who wrote this, I wish I could talk to her.” she said to herself, starting to tear up.

*02/04/2019*

*Dear Diary, ever since you passed away, strange things have been happening. Last night I came to visit your tombstone at the graveyard. Something was off.*

*\~A*

*02/05/2019*

*Dear Diary, things are off. I want to know what's happening.*

“Dang this is getting weird.” Anastasia said to herself. Feeling unsettled, wondering who this mysterious A could be. “This could be a prank right, no way this is real”

“Wait what the f-” a drop of red liquid fell from the corner of the closed book into her lap. The bright crimson red stained into her white pajama bottoms. “No way, this can’t be, I must be hallucinating”

She opens up the book to find the source of the red liquid, but all the pages were still dry. She starts flipping through the pages to find where the writing comes to an end. Alast, she finds what she’s been searching for.

*12/04/2020*

*Hi, I know you are here, I feel you with me. I miss you a lot Julian.*

*\~Anastasia*

“12/04/2020? Wait, thats today.”

“J-Julian?” she stutters, tears streaming down from her eyes. Frantically looking around to find him, seeing nothing but her room.

“What the fuck. What's happening? This can't be.” She stammers as she rushes into the bathroom and locks the door shut."

Most of the time, the LGBTQ representation I’ve seen in stories is either closeted/questioning characters and/or their coming out stories or characters who are gay and face minimal to no homophobic discrimination and just are characters who are also gay. In the graphic novel I’m writing, the main character is a lesbian who was originally gay and proud with a girlfriend but because of her parents and some other homophobic things that happened, she was forced back into the closet. While she’s planning to live a “normal” life and never come out again, she never questions or denies her sexuality to herself since she is fully aware that she’s actually a lesbian.

I was wondering, are there any gay people who’ve been recloseted that could give me some tips on writing a character like this? Or anyone who has any ideas in general. I also would appreciate ideas on how to hint about her previously being out so that the reveal doesn’t come out of nowhere. She’s *really* overly feminine and compensates way too hard to try to convince people that she’s straight which will probably tip off the reader but I want to include more than that. 

 I’m bi myself but I’ve never really struggled a whole lot with the closet since my sexuality isn’t relevant in most conversations and I live in a liberal area. I don’t have a whole lot of experience with the pains of being closeted much less going back to the closet so if anyone can help that would be great!"

Today my professor e-mailed me back about a low grade I had received (I usually average around A-). He claims that I had plagiarized portions of my essay! I logged on to Turintin and realized that he was marking my in-text citations as plagiarism?? My grade dropped drastically from a 91 to 79!!! I’m freaking out, I’ve never ever been accused of plagiarizing my work.

I’m so confused, I used several in-text citations (MLA style) and properly formatted the sources in the “Works Cited” page. Since I mainly used articles or journals, I introduced the sentence with the author/ news site [ex. New York Times reported an excerpt of an interview with James Lean conducted in Central Park, he said “The state of the economy is worrying” (Parkson) ]

I’m obviously not taking credit for this sentence and why would I include the direct link to the source in my “Works Cited” page if I was attempting to plagiarize? 

Purdue Owl says to not include quotations around the entire sentence from the source material but only around the direct quote as long as you introduce it with the author’s name.

In no examples, including ones from the MLA handbook itself I’ve seen the whole sentence in quotations! I don’t know what to do! This is a serious accusation and my grade average has dropped due to this incident, what can I do? How does this constitute as plagiarism?"

This poem was intended to be about a story i heard once that when you you see a butterfly, it is a deceased person who had a lot of love for you and has returned to see you. I used that to portray a thought i had of someone i loved. Where when i die i just want to be by their side, but when they die, they want to be by the side of the person who they love, and i’m there watching the two of them happy as can be together. This person i never knew in real life, but we had an online relationship for a long time.

i’ve always enjoyed poetry and read it often. I just recently got the courage to start it myself. So, here is the first ever poem i have been proud of. Please do offer advice on parts that need to be clarified, or if an area can be strengthened.

Scared of Butterflies - by me.
I have never understood why people were scared of butterflies. 
Had they not heard that when you die 
you come back as a butterfly?
Perhaps the thought of eternal life 
or endless judgement 
or refusal to accept the answer to the forever unknown 
was what made them scared of butterflies.
I always have awaited the moment where i see a butterfly at my wedding 
and i hope it’s a long lost family member
and i make someone proud instead of ashamed for once. 
After all, it’s pretty hard to change the opinions of the dead.

When i die, i want to be a butterfly 
forever at my love’s side.
Years later, now i’m at his bedside 
where he will meet the end of his life.
I was excited for him. 
Scratch that. 
I was excited to be with him
except i’m actually with him 
and we flutter away together
and go back to where we came from 
and see what it looked like from each other’s lives before we were together 
and where 
we pressed send on our first “i love you”
and where i spent the whole day thinking of you.

Hello all, I try to put a good amount of diversity in my writing, but I tend to give everyone a somewhat boring middle class American background. Which I feel like definitely works some of the time, because then I'm still writing what I know, and of course plenty of people of all races do have that background, but I feel like I should probably be branching out more. 

I recently started re-working a story from when I was a kid, where many of the characters are recent immigrants, and two of the main characters are Native American. I was a middle schooler when I started working on it, and sort of just assigned backgrounds randomly, and now I find myself in the position of needing to do the proper research if I'm going to keep everyone's background and ethnicity the way I pictured it. I feel especially weird about the Native American characters, because I feel like there's been a ton of Native American characters in recent media who were just portrayed very badly, and I'm worried I'm going to end up accidentally writing the next Chakotay from Star Trek or something.

So my question is, how do you know when you've done enough research? I've been reading books and watching documentaries and seeing people on tiktok talk about their culture, but obviously it's nothing I've ever experienced. When do you feel confident enough to write someone who's had to deal with prejudices that you've never actually experienced? Obviously I don't want to just write about middle class America for the rest of my life. How do you guys approach this?"

I feel awful a lot of the time, there are a lot of unresolved feelings and regrets, things I wish I had asked him or said to him. 

I’ve had a really hard time continuing to work on the story from before he died. It feels wrong to write about something that isn’t something to do with him. I was thinking of trying to write something about grief, some sort of ghost story, but I don’t know if I’m ready.

I have written a character whose is having a conversation with himself and have differentiated the different opinions as Voice A and Voice B. Below is an example: 

It being a long hard day, and Stephen being the meticulous planner that he is,  thinks back to the neatly wrapped edible.  Two voices speak in his head as he contemplates.
    “If I eat this now, It’ll be 45mins before it really kicks in, giving me time to pick up food, drive home, and land squarely on the couch where I plan to remain comatose for the rest of the night”
    “Yea but you know how this works, if you eat, it will remain in your system by the time you gotta actually fly again, and you know that is exactly when they will drug test you.”
    “One, I don't fly for two weeks, this is one edible..”
“You don't know how strong it is, or even that it's pot.”
“Whatever it is, I don't do drugs often enough for anything to stay in my system.  And two,  the odds of me getting randomly drug tested right once I get back are so slim it’s practically null.”
“Is it worth it?”
“Yes.”
And with that Stephen unwraps the chocolate, and takes note of the smell as he does.

I am unsure if this style reads like I want it too. Would the reader be confused as to what opinion is speaking? What would be a clear way to differentiate between the two without using Voice A or Voice B as the names?

1561,sammyjamez, ,11,writing,1606602308,"Rambo: First Blood is a good example of how stories that are written in a smaller scale can work just as much as those that are set in a larger epic scale, especially in the context of action-based stories. I have always had an admiration for ""smaller"" stories. The scenario feels more real and personal and almost relatable even because as much as the story may be set up in a certain small area or within a small list of characters, they feel quite real and human and relatable but also as though the ""space"" of the scale or the closeness gives the impression that you are just as included in the story once you empathise and relate with the characters.

&amp;#x200B;

By now, Rambo has been deeply embedded in pop culture - chiselled body, shirtless shooting, explosive ammo, guerilla warfare, and countless epic battles with the countless body count. 

The Rambo films are a guilty pleasure of glorification of the stereotypical badass who feels like he can overpower entire armies or even the armies of the world, as though one man can change, perhaps quite literally as Rambo films often take place in settings where the villains have control in many areas of the world or maybe an entire country.

Many action films take this approach, as though in order to make the stake as high as possible, they have to add a scale that is as epic and grand that you cannot imagine, think that the entire country is at stake, or the world or maybe the universe; and one person or a group of people can do this to set things right. 

&amp;#x200B;

But not the first Rambo film. In this film, Rambo is quite capable in guerilla warfare and brutal survival but he is just as vulnerable and scared. He was able to take down large groups of semi-corrupt police officers (without killing them, mind you) through his sheer persistence of possibly years of training, and clever strategy and patience instead of the usual epic level of badassery and shootouts that appear in the other films.

&amp;#x200B;

But what is most appealing is that this takes place in a small remote town (plus a forest that feels like a jungle which Rambo is much more familiar with) and the story feels very personal.

First, Rambo goes to find his friend but finds out that he died of cancer, and then he is being chased by a semi-corrupt police force who kinda abuse their power (only one officer is really ""evil"" in the film that is the only death in the film which Rambo killed only by accident) and also because they are suspicious of Rambo because of how he looks. 

What is more important is that not only this is a different kind of story from the context of scale, but also in the context of how it portrays the themes of the story and its characters.

Like I said before, Rambo is more than capable to take down these police officers but chooses not to and even repeatedly said to them ""did not do anything wrong"" and was acting out of survival. 

He still showed feelings of fear, anxiety, and even pain when we saw the flashbacks of the torture scenes and when he got injured. 

This is a story about the consequences of warfare, even in the context of the Vietnam war as we learn in the beginning that his friend died of cancer because of Agent Orange that was used during that time. What is most important that Rambo initially was not hostile. Sure, he felt out of place especially considering that he probably spent his whole life familiar with war and survival, but he started acting fight-or-flight when he started experiencing flashbacks which is a symptom of PTSD.

Rambo does not win the fight in the end, he surrenders. And also, he cries in the end. He cries because he feels like the war is never over for him. He still feels as though he cannot switch off the survival/warrior mode that he had honed for many years.

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of small and deeply personal type of story is what really appeals to me because it makes the story easier to track and much easier to relate with the characters and explore their depth even though the story may take place in a smaller scale compared to other stories, especially those that involve action or thrills. It makes the characters, especially the protagonists who may or may not need to save the day in the end, feel more human and therefore, more relatable."

Included in this story as a character is Emmett Grogan, who was a member of a San Francisco-based group called The Diggers, which formed during the 1960s. Anyway, a part of his dialog in my story includes excerpts directly quoted and paraphrased from certain Digger documents, which weren't officially published, but rather printed and distributed by The Diggers as part of their philosophies on freedom. I came across these documents via [diggers.org](https://diggers.org), an archive of Digger-related material, history, etc. I've included the link below to the 'publications' I'm referencing specifically. At the bottom of the site, I know it says use of material from these archives needs to be approved by the curator, who I plan on contacting, but as far as citing goes, I'm unsure how I'd go about attributing these quotes properly.

Link: [https://www.diggers.org/digger\_sheets.htm](https://www.diggers.org/digger_sheets.htm)

To be honest, I'm not really sure if and how people cite other kinds of literature within literature. There are a couple other quotes I'm using from Emmett Grogan's memoir as well. Those are a bit less worrisome because they're Grogan's words who will be speaking them within my story, but there is no specific author attributed to the other publications aside from ""The Diggers."" 

Thanks in advance for any advice offered! Please let me know if I need to clarify anything here. I tried doing some research to find an answer to this question, but predictably, most of the results involve directions on how to cite short stories in essays and whatnot."
1570,KittyHamilton,Advice,3,writing,1606595678,"Here's a Flexible Plotting System I Like To Use This is just something that works for me that I’ve cobbled together from various sources.  If you struggle with the middle, or find highly specific story structures confining, you might get some use out of this. This is probably most useful for more mainstream, plot focused style stuff, as opposed to literary fiction or experimental work. I am also writing from a US perspective, and have zero knowledge of storytelling conventions that differ significantly from my culture.

Note that this intentionally does not cover a whole lot of Important Writing Things. This is not the end all be all of everything that should be found in a story. It’s simply a way of plotting and thinking about plot.

I don’t talk about conflict, stakes, goals, and tension, but for most plots, these are major engines of the story. Many if not most changes in a narrative are driven by the protagonist trying to reach goals through engaging in conflicts, or from forces opposing them. The audience is compelled to read more because they want to know what happens next.

You may also want to consider the concept of the ‘sequel’. After a dramatic moment of change, there is often a ‘sequel’ where the characters emotionally react to what occurred and decide what to do next. Use your own judgement when it comes to how you want to treat these moments of the narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here’s the basic building block of the structure: **The Turning Point**

**A Turning Point is a dramatized moment of meaningful change in a narrative.**

Let’s break this down.

**Change:** An alteration of status quo. This can be a big change (Earth explodes) or a little one (someone doubts a long held belief for the first time).  It can even be something that relates more to the perception of the audience than the actual world of the story, like the moment where it becomes clear that the narrator is unreliable. Note that failing to accomplish something can be considered a change, because it requires a change in plans. Changes may also be incremental.

**Dramatized:** It’s shown with characters, dialogue, action, emotion, etc. 

**Meaningful:** Significant and valuable to the audience, and usually the character(s). This usually means that, to the protagonist, the change is either positive, negative, or a mixture of both. It also may be unclear what kind of impact the change will have, as long as the change is significant enough that the audience understands there are likely to be complications from it.

**Moment:** This is meant to be a flexible term. I’ll address it more later.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is not a turning point?**

Characters having a conversation about something, or thinking about something, without coming to some new conclusion. This does not feature change.

Exposition that does not change the narrative in some way is not a turning point. 

The same goes for dramatic events that do not change the status quo, but to reinforce it. For example, if a novel has repeated scenes of a character being bullied, but the bullying never leads to a  break down, the relationship to the bullies changing, a new character stepping in and befriending the victim, etc...those aren’t turning points.

If it is mentioned as an afterthought, or recited as a dry fact with no characterization, it is not dramatized and therefore not a turning point.

Making the change ‘meaningful’ is a challenge in and of itself. But a few rules of thumb:

If the audience literally doesn’t understand what’s going on, it’s not meaningful. 

If the change involves characters they aren’t familiar with, locations they haven’t seen, and events that haven’t yet affected the main narrative, it’s probably not meaningful. 

If it’s a huge pile of information that mostly isn’t yet relevant to the plot, or may never be relevant, it’s not meaningful. 

**Note that just because something is not a turning point doesn’t mean you can’t or shouldn’t include it.** A subtle clue or bit of foreshadowing can be vital without being a turning point. You can use moments to flesh out characters, the world, etc. But turning points are what we’re plotting with, so it’s important to know what they are.

&amp;#x200B;

**How long is a moment?**  
A moment is as long as you need it to be. If you want to meticulously plot out an intense battle scene, treat each strike and shift in the battle as turning points. If you’re writing an epic ten book fantasy series, you might treat each book as its own turning point along a larger narrative. Most of the time, you’ll probably end up treating individual scenes as their own turning points. For our purposes, when I’m talking about plotting, **I’m usually talking about each scene as its own turning point**.

**Turning Points Overlap and Interweave**  
You can have TPs for subplots and various characters. You can think of them as running parallel with or overlapping the main plot however you feel is suitable. Even the main plot may be divided into separate threads. Individual TPs may involve changes to multiple subplots, and causes and effects along separate narrative threads.

**Turning Points have Cause and Effect**  
If you drop a turning point into the middle of a narrative without cause/setup, and it has no influence on anything after it, it might as well not be in there at all. Turning points need setup/foreshadowing/cause and/or effect to be integrated into the narrative. This doesn’t necessarily need to be linear. A TP’s effects may only become apparent after a few scenes have passed.

TPs near the beginning of a narrative often don’t need setup/foreshadowing/cause because the story is just beginning to take shape. TPs near the end often don’t need effects, because the story is wrapping up. Most of the TPs occupying the middle require both.

**Impact &amp; Importance**  
Earlier I mentioned that changes can vary in importance. TPs vary in size, impact, drama, stakes, and relevance. Obviously, this exists on a sliding scale, but in general:

Minor TPs

* Small or incremental changes
* Subdued drama. 
* Lower stakes
* Less causes and effects
* Build up to Major TP

Major TPs

* Huge changes that massively alter the course of the narrative
* Big drama 
* High stakes
* Many causes and significant buildup
* Many effects, massively altering the course of the narrative
* Often have build up from minor TPs

Compare the TP in the drawing room full of dry humor where the protagonist first realizes their rival isn’t as shallow as they believed to the TP in which the protagonist declares their love through their sobs, cradling their rivals head in their lap as they bleed from a wound they received rescuing the protagonist. 

This is important information for plotting. If most of the TPs are minor, the audience might lapse into boredom. If every TP is world ending, then the audience can’t find their footing because everything about the characters, world, priorities, etc. change before they can get invested. So in a typical story, you’ll usually want the biggest major TPs evenly spaced, maybe with some extra at the end for a big climax.

Have you figured out why people tend to struggle with the middle of their narratives?

No TPs in the middle! The Inciting Incident is a big TP, the Climax is a big TP, and everything in the middle is little baby TPs at best or empty of TPs at worst. 

If you like to use other narrative structures to plot, you’ll probably find that most of them fit neatly with this method.

**How do you actually plot with this method?**  
I like to come up with five major TPs: inciting incident, break into act II,  midpoint, dark moment, and climax. I keep in mind the causes and effects of each and use those to pick TPs to go in between. I find it helps to think of the major TPs as governing what happens in between, and treating that bit as a section. 

For example, let’s say the inciting incident TP is a prince being captured by a dragon, and the break into act II TP is the heroic knight acquiring the dragon slaying sword. The protagonist is a knight trying to slay the dragon. I think, what effects would the kidnapping have? There needs to be a turning point where the knight decides he is, for sure, going on a quest to save the prince. He needs to learn about the dragon slaying sword. There may be things or people he needs or wants to take with him on his journey. He also needs to acquire this sword. Because we don’t want this to be boring, maybe he needs to travel through...uh...a spooky forest to get it. And complete three tests? Issued by a fairy? Or something? 

So that gives us some ideas for TPs. He convinces the drunk old monster slayer to take up her axe for One Last Job. Maybe she tells him about the sword. He gets lost in the forest. You get the idea.

But you can figure out what suits you. You might find it most useful as a revision aid, going over what you’ve already written to make sure each scene is adding to the narrative. Maybe just having the idea of TPs in the back of your mind will encourage you to make sure each scene is pushing the story forward as you discovery write. Maybe combining it with other plot structures will help you figure out what works for you and what doesn’t.

TP plotting is flexible when it comes to different plot structures. Zoom in to plot a short story. Zoom out to plot an elaborate, multibook series. Want something semi-episodic with an ongoing plot? Differentiate between TPs that relate to changes only in the ‘episode’ and TPs that affect the overarching plot.

**But How Many Turning Points Should I Have?!**  
Let’s assume we’re talking about scene level TPs only, since that is where most of the plotting takes place. Because the majority of scenes are also TPs, I’ll be treating them as interchangeable.

Pick your medium. Then, find some example works that are about the length you want to go for. Count the number of scenes. That will give you a range of how many scenes you might need.

Alternatively, for novels, look at some scenes you’ve already written and determine their average wordcount. Divide your ideal wordcount by your average number of words per scene. That will give you an approximate number of scene level TPs to aim for while plotting. For instance, if your average scene length is 1.5k words, and you want to write a 90k novels, that’s around 60 scenes.

There are some people who think doing this kind of math or analysis is ridiculous. After all, a story can be any length, and shouldn’t be artificially forced to be a certain length unnaturally. These people are called ‘pantsers’ or ‘discovery writers’ and do not understand our control freak plotter ways. And remember, you can change anything and everything however you see fit. 

**Using TPs to Troubleshoot**  
If you’re struggling with your plot, or don’t know how to fix a problem, you may find it useful to break it down into TPs. Thinking in those terms can be useful. Here are some potential problems and some potential solutions. These are intentionally very, very simplified.

**Boringness:** This is a big, potentially complicated problem. Could be there are not enough TPs, and the narrative stagnates. Check to make sure there are major TPs that alter the narrative dramatically. Do your TPs involve characters, stakes, etc. that the audience finds meaningful, or have you failed to make them care?

**Passive Protagonist:** Make the protagonist the agent of change for more if not most TPs.

**Struggling to develop characters &amp; relationships:** Start with minor TPs involving moments where characters change their minds, entertain new possibilities, develop intimacy, experience doubt, develop or lose trust, etc. Then move on to major ones where the characters change their goals, beliefs, and relationship status. 

**Plot Too Linear:** Include TPs that drastically change the protagonist(s) options for achieving their goals, or their opinion on what their goals even are. Make TPs have effects that appear later in the narrative, instead of immediately after.

**Plot is random and disconnected:** Add causes and effects to TPs.

**Everything comes easily to the protagonist:** Add TPs where the changes that happen make things harder instead of easier.

**Story is too depressing**: Add TPs that involve positive change.

He is friendly to and has more respect for the villian than the hero but refuses to help them.

1572,StormWarriors2,Advice,9,writing,1606593165,"How do I avoid writing like I am a wiki editor? (Telling more than showing) I've been getting a bit of feedback from my beta readers that I really sound like whenever I write like its like reading a wiki article. 

I don't know how to avoid this, as I try to be descriptive (at least I think) I sound more and more like I am giving a lesson in the world about that world I am writing about. 

I have for most of my life been a wiki writer. So it's no surprise to me that my writing sounds like that, but I am wondering among writers on here, is there a way to avoid this other than ""Just don't?"" or ""Practice makes perfect?"" 

I've been practicing for years show don't tell, and I usually avoid telling the audience entirely by using dialogue more than descriptions. But many people have told me personally. That descriptions are helpful to establish a scene, or what it feels like to be there in those circumstances.

I am not sure what exactly entails a wiki-writer style though. I do it all the time but not sure what that means.

If I can't get rid of this style then how do I play into this so I have my own unique voice? Other than practice, I've been writing short stories for a while but I've never heard someone point out that I sound like I am a wiki-editor. It only hit me that was a true statement when I started reading back my material with that in mind.

I don't know particularly, what are everyone's thoughts on wiki writing in terms of style? How do you avoid sounding like a Wikipedia page? Is avoiding don't tell, but using more show in your writing a better way to achieve this? What types of exercises are there that can help me define my writer's voice if I want to keep that? How do you avoid telling the audience but showing them instead?

(I am not a professional writer nor do I ever intend to release a novel, this is for fun mostly)

TLDR: I am writing like I am a wiki editor. How do I avoid this or how can I use this to my advantage to create my own unique voice?"

All the blood, sweat, and tears you pour into it? To not share it? Complete madness. Whether it makes money, costs money, or breaks even, I couldn't wrap my head around the concept of not getting it out into the world. If I'm dumping dozens or hundreds of hours into something, at least making it free on Kindle Unlimited mind yield some results for my efforts.

Needless to say, I've learned quite a few things about writing since then. But perhaps none more important than this: not everything you write needs to be shared.

I've churned out some absolute garbage since then. Worse, I thought it was good when I was writing it.

Now, yes, I could probably rework those stories and concepts into something readable. Maybe even worth reading. But sometimes a mediocre novel/short story/etc is just left in the drawer (or, in my case, in a Google Drive folder.)

It's not that I regret writing these books. Quite the opposite. I think they helped me in a way I couldn't have understood before.

Let me give you some specific examples. I've always wanted to write and publish a horror book.

In October of 2016 I wrote my first ever horror story. I thought it was great. It was about the devil taking the form of a man and seducing an innocent worker with his lies. I thought it was dripping with atmosphere, and had such a unique take on the genre. 

Came back to edit it and . . . the problems were too central to the story, it was badly written, and I'd have to rework the characters entirely.

It's a concept for a book I'd had for a while, but I got it out and I don't have a strong desire to go back and rewrite it or edit it. Sometimes actually writing the book can help you decipher what stories are worth pursuing. Sometimes it takes that much work to get to the point where you're like ""Yeah, this doesn't work.""

And that's okay.

A few years ago I wrote a fantasy horror about the undead coming back to life. I thought it would put a nice spin on things. But it's got pacing problems and in general it feels very samey. It's not as much of a spin on the genre as I wanted. It's not worth trying to fix.

And that's okay.

The strength and benefit from writing these books that nobody else will see is all behind the scenes. It's not 40,000 words wasted. It's 40,000 words that help you grow as a writer. Knowing where you made the mistakes, knowing why it isn't worth pursuing is just as important to a bad story as the opposite is true for a good story.

I've got roughly 5-6 unpublished novels under my belt. I have 3 self-published. I only want to put the best out there—and having unpublished works you can look back on and see why you never published it is a fantastic thing to do.

I recently just finished writing my 3rd horror story, and this is the one I want to publish. This is the one I want shared with the world. But I could never have gotten here if not for those 2 other pieces of trash I wrote."

I am writing an alternate history phsycological horror taking place within Berlin in a history where the wall never fell, and the iron curtain still held steady, pushing further west.

Without going into too much detail, the story is in the perspective of a west bloc German citizen who got himself into the eastern bloc, and writes his experiences down in his notebook. 

I just don't know how to make a story like this interesting, should I put myself into the mind of the journal writer and let my thoughts flow like someone who was writing a journal would be, or should I be methodical about it?"
1614,the_tico_life, ,4,writing,1611358511,"When writing a story within a story (frame narrative) should it all be in quotation marks? I'm writing a book where nearly the entire thing is being told via conversation from the narrator to a couple of strangers. Most of the book will be written within the ""inside story"", but occasionally it will zoom out to the ""outside story"" as the strangers jump in with questions or comments. 

My question is, while telling the inside story, should I have the entire thing within quotation marks as the narrator is speaking? Or will that just come across as annoying and unnecessary for the reader? There will be lengthy periods (10+ pages at least) where it is all inside story, without interruption. So in effect, this means that large portions of the book will all be within quotes. 

Another option is to just disregard the quotes, and start a new chapter everything I break in or break out. The only downside I see to this is that it more difficult to have small moments where we break out only for a short period of time. Starting a new chapter each time would make each framing switch into more of a ""big deal"".

While considering the pros and cons of using quotations, I remembered the story of ""Heart of Darkness"" by Conrad. The entire story is told within quotations, as Marlow is telling it to other sailors on the boat. Conrad regularly zooms out of the main story and returns to the boat. Heart of Darkness is of course a classic, so clearly, it's possible to make it work this way.

On the other hand, there are people who criticize the narration in HoD as being confusing and hard to read due to its format. So perhaps it's not the greatest guide to follow.

What do you think — can the all quotes style work, or would it seem too old-fashioned or needlessly complicated for the reader? 

If you have examples of other books and how they handled this situation, I'd appreciate that too."

I am thinking about what to do after that. My academic background is philosophy, and I have always wanted to write about ecological and societal breakdown - collapse, and why it is so hard to talk rationally and openly about it. This is necessarily very wide-ranging and complicated, and opens up all manner of political, psychological and social cans of worms. It is almost impossible to write a good non-fiction book about it that people will actually want to read, which is why there aren't many. I am now wondering whether a better way to approach it is to try to explore the ideas in the form of a philosophical sci-fi/dystopian-utopian novel. I greatly admire Aldous Huxley and George Orwel.

I've been writing the first draft of my fantasy novel for about 3 months, and I recently finished the first part (of two). From the beginning, my writing philosophy has been that everything I write will be bad, as I am a beginner, and worse yet a teenager, so I should just get the words down as practice and fun.

However, recently I've been thinking that perhaps I should put some time into actually honing the writing itself, rather than just letting the words flow as they naturally would. At the time, I think that just jumping write into the writing was the best option for me, as otherwise, I wouldn't have found the motivation, and I've improved drastically just through the process of writing. 

Do I need to consciously hone my prose? Will my skill continued to increase at a reasonable rate if I continue just doing what I'm doing? I wrote about 100k words in 2020, and very little before that, but is that too soon to start getting bogged down in picking apart my writing style?

Instead of having the MC of my story be “the chosen one” she is just a regular person trying to prove that she is more special than she really is.  Later on in the story, the MC will meet another character who seems to be special and has important responsibilities which frustrates the MC because she feels that this new character is special for no reason other than he got lucky.  

This other character, however, does not feel lucky and wishes that he didn’t have the responsibilities that were given to him.

I also feel like it’s worth mentioning that this other character wasn’t necessarily “chosen” by some prophecy but was born special and as a result is extremely important in the story.

Now dont get me wrong - I think this is completely wrong and women deserve the same rights as anyone else, but in my book, which is third person deep, the men in that same time period dont exactly have those same views. So this is what Im worried about.

On youtube and other places online, many people say that agents are ‘woke’ nowadays and because of this, they wont accept a manuscript if it has discrimination of any kind. My book has discrimination but only because of the time period its set in. I dont want to make the people in my book act like they would nowadays because that would break immersion. I think it’s important to show what time really was like back in the day if Im writing about the past. 

So I have two questions:

1. How do I show that the belief of the men in my book dont align with mine. Cause its third person deep, I have to make the narration sound like they think their beliefs are justified. So how do I in fact show that that is not my beliefs personally. 

2. Will this harm my chances of getting an agent. Again, I dont know if this is correct, but people online and agents (only the very small minority that speak online) say that they wont accept manuscripts with discrimination no matter the reason.

Weirdly, I had 7 years of my journaling on hand, along with other writings, thoughts, rants, stories, and books I've written. I put it all (over a million words) into the bot, gave it a night to process, and now it can write like me... It's incredible, scary, and fascinating all at once. You give it a prompt (or starting point) and it finishes the thought using my prose.

Here's an example, the prompt I gave it is in bold.

I looked out the window of the bus. The city streets blurred by in a haze of unfamiliarity. Maybe it was the magic of the sonder, or maybe it was the distraction of life with constant sensory overload, but something snapped. We, humans, are biologically programmed to see the “summit” in every direction, and that set included me. What we perceive as reality, in our head, is a convenient scaffolding to an artificial world we try to climb. A busy road, a busy city, a busy country, a busy world, is in fact a daily commute to our own temporary cell, within an idle universe as we ride into the greatest comeback of all illusions--the American Dream. And soon our children will look back on our good days as failure to live up to our potential just as we have our parents. The vestige of our past nothing more than a glimmer of an impossible future we set upon ourselves for ourselves.

1648,Wise-Ladder-1663, ,1,writing,1611333430,"Would it be weird and out place for superpowers to be learned in a superhero setting? In my story, superpowers are genetic mutations. And there are 3 ways characters get those genetic mutations. It's pretty much like X men, My hero academia, or The Incredibles


1. Born with genetic mutations. Meaning having superpowers since birth.

2. Get genetic mutations in accidents or experiments that involve radiation/chemicals/particle accelerator.

3. Used your consciousness to change your genetics. And get genetic mutations.

When all 3 numbers come together. They are called superhumans. They all apart of the same system. All 3 categories even share the same superpowers. It's just that the powers are achieved in multiple ways. No ability is really exclusive to one category. But one category does get more of the same power from time to time. 1-2 tends to have a more mutant-like appearance. Being blue and having four arms or eyes on the back of their heads. While number 3 characters tend to have more Charles Altas Batman powers, Life Force chi/chakra powers, and telekinesis/telepathy powers.

Number 3 sounds weird. I know. Number 1-2 is generic. Because it's your typical way your superhero gets superpowers. Either being born with superpowers(I.E X men). Or being gifted superpowers at some point in their life (I.E Spiderman). Number 3 characters learn their superpowers by training and meditating their mind to get superpowers. Number 3 is based on anime power systems or traditional magic systems where the characters learn, practice, and study how to get their powers. Those number 3 sound too out of place to fit in with a number 1-2?

It's like proficients as another category for superpowers in my world. Certain people have genetic proficiency. And their can used that to get superpowers. For example, It's like Daredevil would fit into the number 2 category. Since radiation randomly blinds him at some point in his life and give him extrasensory powers. While someone like Stick gets the same extrasensory superpowers via training. So Stick would fit into the number 3 category in my world.

And also im having a population/who all have powers problem with number 3. Most stories including my own have the mutants, metahumans, parahumans, etc be a small percentage of the earth's population. I feel number 3 could screw that up. Since the superpowers are taught. So anyone can learn them. With number 1 all takes are to win the genetic lottery and you get superpowers. With 2 all it takes is to be in the right place at the right time and you get superpowers. So it's easier to take the population of superhumans small with numbers 1-2.

The best way I could come up with why the whole population of the earth doesn't fit into the number 3 category. I try to pass it off as an athlete thing or wall power thing. That the character has to work hard to get like Bruce Lee or the Ice Man. But didn't sound like a good excuse. I even try to compare number 3 to the myth of hysterical strength in real life where mothers get a huge boost in strength during an increase in adrenaline. Causing them to grab their kids under cars by picking up the car. So I tried to make number 3 characters used their consciousness to unlock their superpowers during times of stress or being in a tough situation.

The best way I can put is
1. Have a natural talent for drawing since they were little kids.

2. Don't have the talent for drawing. Never tried to learn how to draw. But end up in a pretty bad accident that affected their brain. And somehow that turns them into amazing drawers.

3. At first they didn't have the talent for drawing. They always screw up at first. But through hard work and dedication with some more training. They end up becoming masters at the art of drawing."

My books hit those numbers pretty much entirely via word of mouth, without any sort of author platform or mailing list (although I'm finally starting to build that stuff now, seven years too late...).

Anyway, I truly believe that with the right process, similar results are repeatable by anyone. So I wanted to share some notes on why most nonfiction tends to do so poorly, and how to make it more profitable. 

Hope it helps 🤞

&amp;#x200B;

For context: roughly 100,000 nonfiction titles are published each year. And yet:

* The average NYT nonfiction bestseller loses \~98% of its peak sales within a year ([source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0135-y#Sec13))
* Seventy percent of traditionally published titles fail to pay out a single dollar in royalties ([source](https://blakeatwood.com/the-brutal-truth-about-earning-out/))
* Vanishingly few nonfiction books sell even five hundred copies

These are not good results.

In fact, the expected outcome is so grim that you'll hear otherwise sensible folks proclaim that earning a reliable living from nonfiction is straight-up impossible, and that you should therefore embrace your book's predestined doom by reframing it as either passion project or calling card.

Allow me to disagree. (Two week [royalty snapshot](http://writeusefulbooks.com/img/robfitz-two-weeks-nonfiction-royalties.jpg) again.)

The reason the naysayers are so wrong is that they understand neither how nonfiction functions as a product, nor the process behind navigating the uncertainty inherent in designing anything that must survive on its own in the hostile, noisy open market.

&amp;#x200B;

Four too-common blunders that will cripple your book's earnings before it has even been written:

1. Signing with a publisher before you have any leverage
2. Creating a book with an expiration date
3. Writing broadly ""about"" a topic instead of making a clear promise about what the reader will get out of it
4. Giving good advice that fails to cross the air gap and reach the reader

&amp;#x200B;

## Mistake #1: Signing with a publisher before you have any leverage

Publishers are are extremely good at making a big book go bigger, and they are wizards at exploiting the fame, platform, and reputation of an already well-established author. But they don't really know what to do with unknown and unproven new authors. So although they may still sign you, they'll typically withhold the bulk of their marketing support in the early days when you need it most.

An excerpt from [Write Useful Books](https://writeusefulbooks.com):

&gt;To compensate for their 85% share of the royalties, a publisher needs to sell at least 5x more copies for you to break even \[compared to self-publishing\].  
&gt;  
&gt;Well… they can, right? After all, they're publishers. But here's the rub: publishers don't want to blow their budget on a risky, unproven book. As such, they'll only deploy their marketing arsenal once your book has already been de-risked, which basically means that you're either already a best-selling author, you already possess an adoring audience waiting to buy your stuff, or your book has already sold at least 10,000 copies.  
&gt;  
&gt;This can feel a bit unfair. In fact, as an unproven author negotiating with a publisher, much of the discussion will revolve around how you are going to promote your own book. At which point, you might be asking what exactly the publisher is doing to justify their hefty share.

Having a publisher say ""yes"" feels amazing. But doing so at the cost of a bad deal is an ego trap. You should only sell your rights once you're reasonably certain that the publisher is committed to deploying their entire arsenal of marketing and PR resources.

Luckily, there's a pretty slick workaround for those of us who are still starting out. Another excerpt:

&gt;Savvy authors have recently been choosing to self-publish their first ten thousand copies and then transition afterwards into a publishing deal. This preserves full royalties from the early sales (which you hustled on your own in either case) and then allows you to negotiate with publishers from position of strength since your book is already proven.  
&gt;  
&gt;This approach was used by Gabriel Weinberg (Traction) and by Alex Osterwalder (Business Model Generation), each of whom ended up getting an insane deal for first-time authors. It's a strong hybrid approach that maximizes early profits without sacrificing eventual scale.

A signature is forever. And once you sign, you're under the gun; if your book suffer a less-than-spectacular launch (causing the publisher to conclude that your book does not, in fact, have legs), then they'll pull what little support they were giving, forcing you back into doing it all yourself, but for five times less royalties. Instead, consider putting in the work to de-risk it first and then—optionally—transition into a traditional publishing deal once you have real negotiating leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

## Mistake #2: Creating a book with an expiration date

Nonfiction grows most reliably via recommendations, which happen whenever someone who has already received massive value from your book bumps into someone else who would benefit from the same knowledge.

As such, your recommendations (and growth and royalties) are driven by the number of happy readers you've already reached. Which means that time should be on your side: the more people who have read it, the more people are able to recommend it, and the further it grows.

Unfortunately, many authors prioritize the presumed PR boost of writing about a timely (and temporary) trend, topic, or tactic. You do admittedly get some free exposure by writing about a hot topic that's in the news. But is it worth putting an expiration date on your book and sacrificing the power of organic growth and future earnings? I'm doubtful.

For example, my first book's [royalty growth chart](http://writeusefulbooks.com/img/mom-test-growth.png) shows that it took *more than three years* to convincingly exceed $3,000 per month, and imagine if I had written about a topic or trend that lost relevance over time. ([Royalty growth chart](http://writeusefulbooks.com/img/mom-test-growth.png) again.)

Had I chosen a trendy topic instead of an evergreen one, my royalties would have faded away before they ever got started. That one error of scoping would have been the difference between early retirement and a day job.

Of course, for this to work, the book *also* needs to be useful enough to become recommendable, discoverable, and able to be profitably advertised. Which requires a sharp promise.

&amp;#x200B;

## Mistake #3: Writing broadly ""about"" a topic instead of making a clear promise about what the reader will get out of it

One of my all-time favorite nonfiction books is *Hemingway's Boat: Everything He Loved in Life, and Lost*, by Paul Hendrickson. Do you know how many people I've recommended it to? One. And only because I was specifically asked to recommend a biography.

Compare that to another favorite, *The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles*, by Steven Pressfield. Both books wrestle with the same topic of how to remain creatively productive and honest in the face of the uncertainty, chaos, and doubt thrust upon us by life.

And yet, I've bought at least ten copies of the latter as gifts, have recommended it to probably a hundred people individually, and a thousand more via workshops and online writing.

Which raises the critical question: given two books which I adore about largely the same topic, why have I found myself recommending one a hundred times more often than the other? The answer to this question is also the key to unlocking long-term organic growth.

It's because *Hemingway's Boat* is broadly ""about"" a topic, whereas *The War of Art* promises—and delivers—an outcome. When someone is suffering from an acute problem, and you know of a book which solves it, then giving the recommendation is the most natural thing in the world. But this requires that the author be willing to make a clear and concrete promise of who it's for, what it will do for them, and—most challengingly—who it's *not* for.

From [Write Useful Books](https://writeusefulbooks.com):

&gt;Specificity is good. When I was learning to sail, I didn't buy an encyclopedic tome about how to do everything with boats. Instead, I bought a handful of focused problem-solvers with titles like Manoeuvring at Close Quarters Under Power (Johnson), Single-Handed Sailing (Evans), and Living on Twelve Volts with Ample Power (Smead and Ishihara). These books were valuable not in spite of their specificity, but because of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;My all-time favorite nonfiction title: How to Stay Alive in the Woods, by Bradford Angier. Can you guess what that book is promising? Are you able to judge its relevance to your needs and goals? Can you guess which of your friends might enjoy hearing about it? Of course! Because its author was bold enough to declare who it’s for and what it’s going to achieve for them. And it has sold 800k copies across twenty years despite competing against plenty of similar books that are arguably better. In my view, that’s the direct result of making a clearer promise on the cover.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;Will and Ariel Durant even applied this tactic to their own books. After spending more than fifty years researching and writing their eleven-volume magnum opus, The Story of History, they distilled it down into a short, 100-page problem-solver called The Lessons of History. Despite the latter requiring roughly a fiftieth of the time to write, its sales have outstripped those of all their other books combined. Why? Because it offered readers an outcome instead of just a story.

You're obviously free to write whatever you want.

But if you want your book to get recommended frequently enough to grow and succeed without relying on your own fame, platform, reputation, or luck, then you need to take the extra step of explaining to readers what it's going to do for them. 

(Beyond allowing your book to grow, it's also the secret to a five-star Amazon rating. Both topics are covered in [chapter 2](https://writeusefulbooks.com/#contents).)

&amp;#x200B;

## Mistake #4: Giving good advice that fails to cross the air gap and reach the reader

Have you ever listened to someone with so much expertise that they became completely unintelligible to you, the relative novice? They obviously hold the knowledge that you want, but they aren't providing it in a way that can make its way into your brain.

That's the Curse of Knowledge, and it kills an awful lot of books.

A first wave of readers may still buy your book based on its promise, your reputation, and the hype of launch. But if those readers can't understand and act on what you were trying to say, they aren't going to recommend it, and your royalties will show a sharp spike followed by a swift decline into obscurity, [like the lowest line in this doodle](http://writeusefulbooks.com/img/posts/launch-vs-growth.png).

(Which is, incidentally, [exactly what happens to the average nonfiction best-seller](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0135-y#Sec13).)

The solution is the same as with any other product: to increase the number and speed of testing and iterating with real readers, including both Reader Conversations and Beta Reading. Not waiting to ""get feedback"" after the book is already polished and beautiful, but beginning as early as possible, while it's still rough, ugly, embarassing and—crucially—able to be significantly restructured without wasting loads of detailed editing work. 

The above is a bit of a bigger topic and probably deserves its own post, but if you're in a hurry to hear my take, you can check [chapters 3 and 5](https://writeusefulbooks.com/#contents).

“Fuck this!”

“Just calm down and at least get the stuff first”

As the moon comes clear of the clouds, a tall ginger girl shivers as the midnight wind beats at her skin.

“What the hell is taking him so long?” She clinches the sides of her arms. Cheeks red, as she constantly rubs her hands against them.

“He’s a dealer, they take all the time in the world. Don’t be too bothered by it.”

“But I’m cold!”

“You deserve it for wearing that out at 1 o’clock in the morning, in the middle of the fall!”

“But I just had too! The boots, the skirt, the Hello Kitty tee! It just fits together, you know?”

“No I Don’t but it’s whatever I guess. Shit...he’s here.”

An all white sedan starts to pull up to them blasting some shitty rap group no one likes.

“Lindsay! Grace! How have my favorite two girls been,” he shouts over the music as he turns it down.

“No she still isn’t gonna date you Matt,” Grace says with a scowl on her face.

“Is that a new tattoo?”

“Shut up and just give us what we want, so we can all go home” Rolling her eyes in disgust, she hands Matt a handful of 20 dollar bills.

“Why, thank you for your patronage! I hope you buy from us-”

“Just give it to me,” Lindsay screams out from impatience.

She grabs the end of her shirt, looking down embarrassed. Grace sighs and holds out an empty hand, looking at Matt with pursed lips. He sighs as he reaches into his car’s glove box and grabs a bag of weed and hands it to her.

“See you shits later,” he squeals as he pulls away.

“Asshole! God I hate him”

“Didn’t you date him for like...nine months,” Lindsay questions.

“Dude can you shut up about that!”

Grace storms away, with tear filled eyes. Lindsay rushes after her. After catching up, she reaches and grabs Grace’s hand as they walk. The street of their neighborhood tends to be very quiet at night. The small cottages lining the road. After passing an old convenience store, they both stop. They enter their flat which looks like what you’d expect it to. They sit on the tattered old couch that was bought at a garage sale.

“ Hurry up and make it already,” Lindsay exclaims.

“Just give me a sec alright?”

A few moments later they sit on the couch high, hungry, and bored. “What do you want to eat, I probably just order delivery,” Lindsay sits up and looks at Grace. Grace rubs her burning red eyes and sits up. “Fuck, probably some like Chinese,” she says nodding her head as if she is trying to assure herself. “ But get like everything!” They both burst into mindless laughter for about 5 mins when Grace leans over to see the time. “FUCK! I was supposed to be at work an hour ago,” She screams at the top of her lungs. “Go get dressed, I’ll make sure you get there on time,” They both have been through this before. So Lindsay was always prepared by having Ubers scheduled on days that Grace worked.

“Your Uber is almost here you gotta hurry,” Lindsay screams across the room. Grace comes flying out of the room half dressed. She quickly puts her clothes on and ties her shoes into very messy knots that look more like deflated pretzels than actual shoelaces. “Alright you know the rules, DON”T FUCK EVERYTHING UP,” Grace exclaims before she leaves out the door.

Lindsay mutters under breath and crosses her arms.

Grace gets in the Uber and rides a silent ride to the shop she works at. “You're late again Grace,” an older looking black man steps out from the office and looks at her. “Sorry Mr. Moody. It won't happen again,” she replies looking down at the ground knowing this is the 5th time she’s said that this month. Moody looks at her and sighs, “ Just go get ready for your shift.” 10 hours pass and Grace gets ready to leave. She gets home to see Lindsay in a pink onesie and listening to John Wayne. “ I didn’t know you liked Cigarettes After Sex,” Graced looked shocked that Lindsay, the girl she had know for liking Sanrio and Harajuku fashion knew a band like that."

Birth of a legend

\* The sound of a baby crying is heard \*

The mother sits in a ruined house, trying to calm the child, the sound of an explosion is heard outside, the child cries and cries, it is a bad thing, it goes on for a long time until the enemy arrives in the city. Many citizens were killed that day.

The moment is like this: a woman is standing against a wall and a child is watching from a distance, she saw something she should not have seen, she lost her mother that day, she had to save herself somehow, she had a great future. Her name is Hubert Greaves. Her nickname is Navagostostis. He has a whole history, he was born in 5037, as a child he had to go to different schools five times, he was raised by his grandmother, he was in a miserable life, then there was a war and a terrible disease ""Ixtera"" from which many died. At school he had problems with students. Made a friend with whom he spent the most time. When he was 14 years old, he entered the military academy, with his friend, he learned a lot there, 3 weeks later he became a first-class warrior.He had to take part in the war.

Norok-Ereti War =

Hubert is sitting in the trench, contemplating, the sound of fighting is heard when suddenly ...

Hubert, are you alright? - asks his friend, this is Samuel Sokolov, his faithful friend.

I'm fine, I'm a little nervous, I think it's a bad thing .. Hubert said thoughtfully

I have some doubts too- agreed Samuel as I know the Third Front has a problem.

Better help, said Hubert.

I totally agree with you, but the captain may not agree with you, Samuel said a little nervously.

\* Scream is heard \*

""I do not have to do anything!"" He said and ran away.

Hubert Grivs! Stop it! There was a loud scream, it was the captain.

Hubert did not listen, fled to the third front, the enemy was lurking in the building, there was a gas cylinder near them, also Hubert was standing nearby, he had the courage to shoot the gas cylinder, so he saved the third front, and so lost his hand.

\-Hero Hubert-

The walls are white, the bed too, and in this bed lies Hubert, the piece has his hand replaced, he can feel nothing but pain, the doctor is standing next to him, and suddenly the sound of the door opening was heard, the captain came in, approached Hubert.

Hubert Grivs! He shouted sternly.

Yes sir! He replied nervously.

The captain took off his hat and took it in his hand, closed his eyes and said:

You are a worthy warrior, rejecting the captain's command, standing on the whole side of the enemy, blowing up a dagger balloon, this is true courage. I have no one as brave as you, you are a hero and you belong to the rank of sergeant.

Then today Hubert was already done, he could even use his hand, and walking, he decided to see a friend.

6th attempt =

Laboratory, a white dead place where many tables are in different solutions. The goal is to invent an Ixtera drug. This operation will be difficult, this is already the sixth attempt, and scientists have bad expectations. One mixes different colored liquids with each other, observes the blood under one microscope, the work goes on. The experimental medicine was created after a long time, and also for a long time they wanted to find a volunteer. When he was given a drink, he tasted it, sighed and got a normal face again, everything went well for a while, one scientist put a slight smile on his face, but in vain, suddenly this man went crazy and started screaming, it was the worst, sometimes they just died, now poisoned, The scientist was bitten, and then a large gas cylinder jumped, suddenly the doors were knocked down by the warriors, aimed at the poisoned man, at which point the scientist shouted: No, no!

The warrior could not hit the poisoned, the warrior hit something else, it was written HJÖ2 on top, which contains the most dangerous substances.

There was a big explosion, dazzling, everything was destroyed, and suddenly \* boom! \*

The plane crashed where Hubert and Samuel were traveling, the plane was not very high so many were not killed, Hubert and Samuel survived, suddenly the pilot shouted something misunderstood and gave both of them an excuse. They picked it up and did it, then went to the pilot and asked questions.

Many could not understand anything, at the same time the pilot wore their protective armor, and told

Go south, there you will meet a large ship, then you will leave from here. The wounded pilot was telling.

Yes but you? Asked Samuel

Go! I somehow saved myself ... said the pilot nervously.

Come on, sir. Replied Hubert in astonishment.

They were in the middle of the road, there were ruins here and there, wrecked cars and ships, the earth was no longer what it used to be, before the earth was green the streets were completely clean, now the grass is green and the streets are orange sand. The sky is dark brown. You will not see anything but bad.

Hubert and Samuel go, and there they see a large ship and luggage, a reinforced detachment standing outside, guarding the ship, Samuel and Hubert enter the ship, and leave for the planet “Octarus”."

I dated a beautiful, intelligent, crazy woman for three years, and to say that I was in love was an understatement. This woman had everything; gorgeous curly brown hair framing a delicate face with plump, delicious lips, a brilliant scientific mind with passions to pursue a career in medicine, and most importantly an entirely unique outlook on the world that she never wavered from. She burned with a fire that I had never experienced before, and her bubbly personality quickly dismantled my self-enforced isolation. She was amazing. And I was convinced that I was going to marry this woman. But life never really turns up where you want it to. I found myself being berated for being the human being that I am. 

A very, very sad one.

Life hasn’t been particularly cruel to me, and I have no crushing backstory to solidify a reasoning for this gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach. It’s just always been there. For as long as I can remember it has. 

Anyway, after three years, this woman had had enough, and told me to pack up my things and hit the road. Being a college student, and not living so far from home, I was not cast upon the street and had a decent fallback.

 I withered in my sadness for what seemed like centuries. A far worse panging in my stomach had taken hold, and as the weeks went on it showed no sign of letting up. The therapist that I was speaking to didn’t understand a damn thing I said. A parrot squawking the same things to patients all day. Incredibly important details slipping from her mind and repeating the same things week after week made things even worse.

And then I got a phone call.

She missed me. And she wanted to see me. About a month and a half had passed, and I had asked her if anything romantic had transpired between her and other people during our breakup. She told me that nothing had happened. I went back up to school for a week, and we only left the bed for the essentials. At the end of the trip, I found out that she had slept with two guys during our break, and left feeling like my balls had been pulled over my head. 

I know we weren’t together. I wouldn’t have cared had she just told me the truth. Honesty had always been an obstacle for her, and I think that this time it cost us the relationship that I dreamed of making into a family.

1674,proriterz,Discussion,1,writing,1611305589,"Busting 5 common content creation myths. I guess no one will deny the fact that Content is the fire and Media is the gasoline!

***Whose content is going to get Viral overnight, no one can ever predict it. All we can do, is to put our best efforts to make sure your Content catches the 'Fire' you want!***

As a result, overcoming myths in the content sphere is an important step to make your online presence a solid one. While you can always do your research to implement smart strategies, try not making assumptions or propagating any such myths for content creation:  


* **ALL YOUR CONTENT SHOULD BE ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS**

While it is natural that you will develop a niche and your content will tend to oscillate around that niche, all your content need not strictly be talking about your business. If fact, if it does, it might get a little too monotonous. Try to keep it interesting and valuable for the audience. An interesting touch of humour, current events, etc can make your brand relatable for anyone.  


* **EVERY PIECE OF CONTENT SHOULD DELIVER SALES TO BE CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL**

A targeted advertisement can have the purpose of generating leads and ROI directly, but the same isn’t true for every piece of content that you use for your brand. Some interesting trends and ideas that you might present with your content will naturally not deliver direct sales, but such content pieces are relevant to build your brand, which in turn, will drive better sales.  


* **EXCESSIVE CONTENT CAN GENERATE MORE ROI**

It is important to be consistent with your content on different social media platforms. However, how much you post isn’t directly proportional to the ROI. Sometimes posting unnecessarily just to tick your check box for the slot can appear to be spammish and annoy your audience instead of fulfilling the intended purpose.  


* **ANYONE CAN CREATE GOOD AND TARGETED CONTENT**

It can be tempting for brands to rely on cheap content creation services to get more value for the same price. But is it truly more value, if the content isn’t crafted to the supposed job? Creating content for a brand is not a task that should be assigned to “just anyone”. It is always better to rely on someone with a little marketing experience and understanding of the platform to accomplish this.

* **IMPLEMENTING SOMEONE ELSE’S STRATEGY CAN DELIVER SUCCESS**

Another myth that really needs some busting is blindly following the footsteps of a success story. What worked for one brand or individual might not work for you. It could even drive you in the opposite direction if you copy the strategies instead of understanding why they worked. Educate yourself to create a custom-strategy for your content and fine-tune it as per the results you observe.  


That being said, I guess there *aren't any rigid rules regarding what exactly is wrong or right*. It all depends, ultimately, on what your **audience loves and wants to consume**.

For example, some audiences would only love to have strict on-point, B2B insights, while some brands love to communicate their message more casually with some fun artifacts!  


And that's how you can grow, digitally!

From a certain perspective, they all ""failed."" I'm not here to cry to you about it or complain, instead I wanted to break down what I think I did wrong and what I should do in the future, because I imagine it'll serve as a useful lesson for all you other writers.  


The reason I had so much time is that in 2019 I returned to study at University, so I had long breaks, as well as flexible hours when I was studying.  


So let's get started.  


1. **Adventure fantasy sequel** 

This first novel was a sequel to an adventure fantasy that I wrote. The first book actually worked really well (just doing edits on it at present) and I wanted to continue the story. I wrote a 100,000+ word manuscript, and when I reviewed it, I found I only really liked the first 15% of the novel. What happened? With this one I relied a lot on a ""scene-by-scene"" outline, which was pretty rigid. I also was in a rush to get it finished because University was starting soon. What ended up happening was a lot of it I was writing for writings sake, and the quality of the draft wasn't up to my usual standard. I'll probably use some of it if I retry this book, but as a whole, the draft isn't good enough to edit/refine - it needs to be mostly rewritten.  


Lesson: Slow down, enjoy the process, and if the plan feels ""off"" then change it.  


**2. Supernatural romance/horror/fantasy** 

I wrote this novel midway through the year. The premise of it was unlike other books I had tried. It was about a man who begins to suspect that his wife might be a witch, while she seems obvious to her magic. I used a scene-by-scene outline with this one, and had a fair amount of world-building. The writing was pretty quick and I got through the draft in good time. The problem? When I reread my draft, I realized that I only liked the first 30% of it. The rest of the novel became sort of dry and boring, just going through the motions. Again, being too rigid in my planning meant I missed a lot of great opportunities. If I had been more honest with myself, I would have dumped the plan and gone in a new direction at the 30% mark.   


Lesson: Have a better idea of the concept before you try and write the whole novel. Just because it looks good in the plan doesn't mean it will work.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Dystopian space novel**   


This one I only got about 25,000 words into. It was set in the future where Earth has become a chaotic nightmare so an all-powerful organization has set up a colony on a volcanic planet that they are terraforming. I really liked the idea of this and had a lot of fun planning it out... but when I got to writing it, it got to a point where it just felt dry and boring. Then I realized that I didn't even like the THEME of the novel. I realized it was way too ""preachy"" and on the nose, so I just decided to quit. It was like the story was just a vehicle for the message, instead of writing the story for its own sake.  


Lesson: Don't let your theme or moral message overpower your story and make it boring/unnatural  


**4. Interdemenisal organization sci-fi**   


After these three failed novels, I decided ""okay, no more plans! Just write it."" I felt like I'd choked my natural creativity with the other three novels I had written, so I wanted to try one without a rigid scene-by-scene plan. The premise of this one was a girl gets pulled into a special organization that stops tears in reality after an interdimensional monster kills her mother. Initially, this one went pretty well. I felt the concept was a little overdone, and wasn't too sure about the characters, but I was writing a lot and writing quickly and having fun. I stopped at about 20,000 words during a transition between Acts, because I realized that the concept itself wasn't juicy enough. It felt too ""weak."" It's hard to describe. It was like I had just run with the first idea that had came into my head instead of carefully vetting it. So I quit.  


Lesson: Don't be desperate to write a novel. Just wait for the idea that really captures your imagination, not the one that ""sounds okay.""  


I hope my failures can save you from making some mistakes! I don't feel bad about all of this, because it's led me to discover my own method of writing, which so far has been working great! I think we all need to ""burn through"" a certain amount of words before we really figure out our unique style and method."
1685,celtic296, ,1,writing,1611295218,"Tragedy has beauty Tragedy can be haunting yet beautiful at the same time. Pictures can immortalize scenes to evoke such emotion in someone that makes it beautiful. Take, for example, the image of the Falling Man. To some, it is nothing but a picture of a man falling from a building, yet to others, it is a scene of a man's final moments after jumping from the World Trade Center during 9/11. It shows man's strength as a whole of willing, knowing that you have a choice of how to end it, along with knowing that today is now the day nothing will stop this. That man had the option of burning to death, of suffocating, falling to death, or wait until it all came down. He chose what he thought would be the fastest and most painless. I wonder if those last few seconds were what was going through his mind knowing that this was no way out. Was he saying goodbye? Was he saying a pray?

The idea is a grunge band that shoot like, lightning or lasers out of their instrument (depending on the character) with 

1. A punk/skinhead (yes I know they're two very different subcultures) inspired bassist that has a laser Mohawk which he channels through a Pickelhaube like cyclops from x-men (yeah I know I went a bit crazy with the character but it's not to be taken seriously because I'm not a great drawer) and also wears docs, ripped denim jeans, suspenders and a bomber jacket.
2. A kind of 'femboy' drummer, just a dude who wears crop tops and fishnets and cat ears and stuff that are stereotypically female. They're also into thrash metal and kind of hardcore.

So I've got a really solid grip on these two characters in my head and I really like them, but I need the sub's help on my third and fourth characters. See, I was thinking of having one kind of 'folk-punk' inspired character, like, scrappy, denim vest, flat cap, that sort of thing. Then the other character would be like 'skater/stoner' with a banie or hat and hawaiian shirt with tan shorts and vans, but I just wasn't happy with the folk-punk character. He didn't have enough of an identity. So I decided to fuse the two, and now I've got basically the same design for the skater character except he switches hats a lot, from a baseball cap to a beanie to a tweed flat cap and listens to folk-punk. He plays guitar in the band.

The problem is, now there's a vacuum I need to either fill or leave. The band could be a trio or I could design a fourth character but I'm really not sure. There are so many directions I could take the character, they could be a metalhead (secondary guitarist) or a more introverted kind of character (keyboard player or something), maybe even a rude boy, with a suit and tie and hat who's into reggae

I'm not sure where to take this fourth character, so I'd really appreciate any help"

“Fine! Stay and sleep the day away. This is our last day as kits. Tomorrow, we’re going to be Softpaws. You know what that means?”

“Yep. Work, work, and more work tomorrow,” Pebble replied, groaning. “Just let me sleep.”

Silver huffed and turned around. She padded towards the entrance of their den. Ears twitching, she turned her head back to Pebble and smiled slyly.

She slowly moved her tail side by side, and stretched into a playful position. “Let’s jump on him!”

Pebble smiled and purred with delight. His brother had pounced on him and his sister---it was time for him to get snuck up on! They both snuck around and looked for their brother outside the den. 

“I don’t see him,” whispered Pebble. He scratched at the ground. He made a circle. “This is the Water Tribe camp.” He made another slash in the middle, dividing it in half vertically.

That said, there will be some very unavoidable ways your writing will have to use -ing verbs.

I generally try to lean toward 'writing what I know' mostly because I find that helps my writing feel authentic. But of course many characters, plot points, scenarios, and themes touch or at times directly address social issues more directly felt by other people.   


I don't intend to make the mistake of suggesting that any one person from a minority group has a representative opinion of all the people in that group, nor that one persons okay gives me 'permission' to write about certain things.

I had a few specific questions but any advice that you have would be appreciated. Our plan so far is to use Brandon Sanderson's tips for writing groups for when it comes to critiquing and discussion. We also plan to have a short 'lesson' where someone covers a topic for 5 minutes or so, and then we all discuss how we can apply it, thoughts, etc. We just sent out everyone's submissions for today and next week will be when we are getting together. 

This will be over zoom so there's no printing out hard copies to give to people with notes. Do you all recommend taking notes as you critique and giving it to the author or should the author just take their own notes as we discuss? If you do recommend giving notes, what's the best way people have found to do this online? Also, is there anything you recommend to help keep the group focused so that we can use our time wisely and effectively? Or the best way to format these meetings?

1708,minimouahaha, ,3,writing,1612889295,"Tell me if I am a ridiculous white person ridiculously writing POC!! I am white and writing a novel about London in the sixties where there was obviously loads of racial tension: the aftermath of Notting Hill riots, Windrush, Commonwealth Immigration Act. And so I have been trying to read some books to deepen my understanding of attitudes to help shape and inform the diverse narratives of the people of colour in my book. (Writing the Other, Black and British, various interviews with members of Caribbean communities about daily life living in London and Manchester in 1960.) 

 A summary: 

A white grandmother guilt-ridden because of something terrible that she did in the past, she confesses it to her granddaughter to seek some sort of redemption for an act that is beyond redemption. It's a meta-fiction and the granddaughter writes the grandmother's story from the POV of the other characters that the grandmother describes, including POC. In the novel, there will be a discussion of differences and similarities in feminism and racial discourse between the two eras (the past echoing into the present). 

I was feeling good about my POC, an unethical, Korean journalist, a Pakistani music director and her judgemental, nail-biting son, an audacious Antiguan who runs as a radical magazine. 

But then it all turned sour. I was talking to my teacher about what this 'beyond-redemption' event could be, and she said that perhaps she could have a baby with a black man, and with pressure from her ultra-conservative family she falsely accused the man of rape and has to give up her baby - this is the event she wants to atone for. 

I told her that I would think about it, and literally couldn't sleep last night thinking of all the ethical implications. A white woman (me) exploring if there is a way to forgive another white woman for ruining the life of a black man. Do you think there is an ethical way to approach this?"

I ask because, as writers often do, I take inspiration from my life. For example, how do you deal with something like writing a story with abusive patents? 

Having been an emotional neglected child, I would naturally draw heavy inspiration from my experiences (as we all do). But if I were to do that, and a friend/family member were to read it, it would be painfully clear where the inspiration came from. 

And I don’t want that truth to come out. Some of the truths I’ve written are long forgotten and I wouldn’t want to bring up old wounds. But at the same time, it seems dishonest to the story/characters to avoid taking inspiration from your own experiences and not writing.

It has to do with my own personal history, and I get that it can be inflammatory and that many readers will be turned off by it, but I don't care. 

I just want to write it, and through it find other people who have gone through similar experiences. I've already gained some readers who told me how meaningful the story is to them, but I'm afraid that as my views and readers grow I will get reported, as a lot of platforms (RoyalRoad and Scribblehub for example) don't allow this discussions in their fictions. You can write about it only if it's a complete and utter fantastical world, but I really don't feel like writing another generic fantasy, and the references to religion are important for the motifs and plot of the story.   


So, if you know of any platform that allows such a discussion. Think along the lines of ""Handmaids Tale"" type of stories. Please do share. I'm not here to make waves and through my profile you won't find what I'm writing either, I just want to be able and discuss events in my life through fiction even if some people find it hard to stomach."

As a reader, I love the feeling of getting sucked into the world of a novel.

A 3rd wall break destroyes that completely 

Maybe in some kind of comedy novel, you could justify it.

Of course, they constantly screw with how horrible my punctuation is. 

Now, I'm so tired of people making fun of my punctuation, and I seek revenge to show those pricks of mostly school professors, or teachers, from ever bullying my writing ever again! 

What does punctuation matter? It's about what heart you put into the writing! You can have all the greatest techniques, but if you are a heartless human being, your writing will suck either or. 

You do need to market yourself. You can have an excellent product, but if you do not market at all, your product will not sell. That has been the case with many talented people throughout the years such as Tesla, Steve Jobs, Xerox employees, Nietzsche, and many more. 

I will learn from their mistakes and rise above to perfect my punctuation, and destroy those pompous pedants, who claim they know something about ""writing"", when actually they only know technique - nothing about what really takes to create an essay full of emotion!

1769,Ironicity,Discussion,4,writing,1612849957,"For those that write romance plots, do you feel your own characters' chemistry? I'm writing a fantasy, with a heavy romance subplot between the main characters. One thing I find is that part of the allure of a good romance plot is how quickly things move in a book. You discover the development of the characters in a fast, logical, scene-by-scene unfolding, and sparks fly off the page. I can read most standard length romance novels within a day or two. But the tables are turned when it comes to *writing* romance. Because writing any book takes a long time, as an author, you struggle through the development of your characters' relationship over the span of months, or closer to a year especially for fantasy. You get to know your scenes so well that perhaps you don't feel the same excitement and magic as a potential reader might.

So my question is this for those who write romance or romantic subplots: I'm curious about how you feel regarding your characters' relationship during the drafting process? Do you feel spellbound by your characters' chemistry the whole way through writing your first draft? Or does it slip into feeling rote because of how long you've been slogging away at the whole novel?"

1771,dumbtorchic,Advice,10,writing,1612847063,"Is a sense of mystery necessary for a narrative? I remember talking with a group of other writers once and someone said that every good story needs a sense of mystery for readers to be invested in it. now, I feel like they meant it more along the very basic lines of something like “will X get what he wants? will Y save the day? will Z find her long lost brother?” etc etc. but I’ve been thinking about it a little. 

most of the fiction I read tends to stay in the heads of the protagonist(s), so there is a very pressing sense of mystery as to what the antagonist is doing, or what he/she might send the protagonist’s way. however, in the things I’ve been working on, both the protagonist and antagonist’s perspectives are explored, where the reader will know both what the protagonist is doing and what challenges the antagonist might throw at them. so with this I’m wondering if doing this betrays or undermines the overarching sense of mystery, as the reader is basically well-acquainted with the possibilities. how are you supposed to keep a reader on their toes, so to speak, if they know what’s coming? is “how will X react to this event?” mystery enough? is a “sense of mystery” even necessary?"
1772,the_tortfeasor, ,10,writing,1612846981,"Don't let a bad chapter stop you from writing a good book. You can rewrite a bad chapter. You can't fix a book that doesn't exist. Have you ever wanted to quit working on your WIP because you just hit a chapter that you couldn't write? Or maybe you wrote it but it was shit. This happens to everyone and you should never let it stop you from writing your story. Just put words down on paper (or Word Doc) and fix it later. Get the bones down. The details don't have to be perfect. They won't be anyway. 

On my last book, there was one chapter that I probably rewrote completely three or four times. The first draft sucked, but there were nuggets of goodness hidden within. They made it into the final draft. 

It's easy to let a minor setback derail your whole project. You have to be persistent and disciplined to beat that doubt that will drag you down. Writing is hard. There will always be friction that slows you down. There will always be a voice inside you that tells you to quit or take a break or procrastinate in a million ways.  Your job is to beat that voice into submission and write."

This is where the protagonist lives. They live in a rocky canyon that is surrounded by forest. They shelter in a warm cave lined with pine needles that lies at the mouth of the canyon. They have a river running through the middle of their territory.

They live in a sunny field near a lake that is filled by the first pack's river. They shelter in old fox dens lined with grasses.

The third pack:

They live in a shadowed swamp that is almost always dark. They have many spooky trees in the area, and den under fallen trees.

There's a story I've been working on for a few years and never finished due to procrastination and trying to finish my doctorate.

She's my favourite character I have ever created (even though I didn't really create her, she just showed up!).

1814,IndomitableSam, ,10,writing,1614466854,"Third Person Present vs Past Afternoon all;

I'm having a bit of a tough time deciding what tense I want to use. I know all the pros and cons of each - present tense puts you closer to the character(s) and feels personal, and works well to draw in the reader and make them feel like they're in the moment. Like they're watching a movie, and gives the sense of everything being in the now - feelings and sensations and such.

But - third person past is kind of the default. And allows you to see more of what's going on - more than just the POV character sees and feels. And I'm finding I'm slipping into it. I usually write first-person present tense, and am starting a dual POV work - fully outlined. 

The thing is, there will be a lot of memories in the story. Not flashbacks, it will be a memory they're thinking about/musing over, not a full scene or flashback. But there will be a lot of looking backward from both characters. 

I want to stick to third person present, but I worry (because I already have) I'll slip into past and stay there, even after a memory is finished. It's going to be quite a challenge.

I know there will need to be a recognizable shift between the now and the then, though. Is this something I should be attempting, or should I just stick to third person past? 

What are your thoughts? Do you find shifts jarring? I'm no expert, so I may be taking on a lot here in wanting to flow between the now and the then with different tenses. Where have you found this working well, and where hasn't it?"

1819,chuckfinley27, ,4,writing,1614463719,"How good research can make your writing better. Hey everyone! I've been doing the freelance writing by day, creative writing by night thing for a while, and I wanted to share what I've learned about research. Because good research often = good writing, and I think a lot of writers (myself included, lots of times) skip the research and head straight to the fun bits. Here we go:

**There’s a pattern among good writers:** Behind their best writing is a copious amount of research.

And this is true because there’s no such thing as an original idea; great writing and interesting stories don’t come from nowhere. They are thousands of ideas and experiences, put into a few words that we read in some amount of minutes.

This isn’t unique to writers, either – Albert Einstein was led to some of his most revolutionary ideas by science fiction authors. Everyone who writes good ideas gets them from somewhere.

**That somewhere is research.** Improving your research is imperative to becoming a better writer. But, how do you actually do good research?

Here’s a framework to approach it. Let’s call it (uncreatively) **The Research Framework.**

# First, broaden your scope.

**Everything is research, if you are consuming it with intent.**

Poets do research when they observe the world around them. Fiction authors do research when they listen to history podcasts and then, later, base a fictional race on real history.

I can shamelessly admit that a good chunk of the ideas in this post came from a Radiolab episode I listened to recently (at least the Einstein bit). That’s research, baby.

**How to do this well:** Start *actively* paying attention to things. When you’re reading, listening to a podcast, having a conversation, pay conscious attention to what’s happening and why.

# Then, research for an unreasonable amount of time.

**You want your starting material to be everyone else’s best material.**

To read that “best material”, you need to research for an absurd amount of time. Doing more than your share of research accomplishes two things:

**1. You have upgraded your writing before you’ve even put the pen to paper.** If you know all there is to know, your writing will be better as a result.

**2. You will (usually) come up with your own unique take on things.** The more ideas you take in, the more spin-zone action that happens in your own brain. This will also improve your writing.

**How to do this well:** If you write fantasy, read great fantasy. This applies to pretty much any type of writing; you want your research to be diverse, but you also want to read ""the best"" on whatever you're writing about.

# Finally, write as naturally as you can.

**This is my favorite part about research: If you’ve done it right, writing becomes so much more natural.** You aren’t second guessing; you’re a Porsche 911 hurtling down the fastest track in the world.

Plus, if you feel confident about your writing, it’s more fun. That’s always a bonus.

**And, finally:** If you want to use all the above as an excuse to do “research” like taking a day off to read or go on a hike, definitely do that.

**Now, a question for you:** How do you incorporate research into your writing? I know that lots of the people on this sub are fiction-focused, so I'd love to hear how you bring research into the fiction you write."

Every other week I'll have to learn how this works or ask someone for advice on this or that. So while I *could* just say ""I'll write for x hours each day"", I don't know how researching fits into that.

**MECHANICS, EXPECTATIONS VS REALITY, EUPHEMISMS, AND METAPHORS**

I am vehemently against hard and fast rules for how to write fiction-- ANY way to do something can be done well. For me, it’s way better for a writer to try something, have it fail, and then learn why it failed, then just to be told not to do that thing. That might just be me and my autism, but in working with other creatives and also absorbing different media, I’ve found that LOTS of writers have tried and SUCCEEDED at plenty of stuff that the rest of us have been taught NEVER to do. C. S. Lewis loved him some run-on sentences. E E Cummings (google doc’s autocorrect will NOT allow me to type that in lowercase as he preferred) told both capital letters and sentence structure to go fuck themselves.

In a literary world that has cemented itself as being overwhelmingly white and cis-male, I want to encourage EVERY writer to do WEIRD AND WACKY SHIT and break the mold.

THAT BEING SAID.

Here are some guidelines that I tend to follow when writing sex scenes, and that I’ve had novice smut peddlers struggle with or ask me about.

**MECHANICS:** As I mentioned before, in \*general,\* cis men want mechanics and cis women want emotion. That doesn’t mean that if you want your scene to be more emotional that you should ignore mechanics altogether. No matter how well Tiger Woods swings the club, people still want to see the ball go into the hole.

If what really turns you on about a scene is imagining your character’s breasts bobbing up and down on each thrust, go ahead and include that. If your character’s penis is huge and it feels AMAZING pushing into whatever orifice it wants to occupy, use that detail. What I generally see turning readers off are long-winded descriptions of exactly how each person is positioned, how many times the penis is going in the vagina, clocking the bpm of his thrusts, etc.

Now, if a mechanical description is adding to the scene, then by all means throw it in. If he’s thrusting faster now, if she turns so that she’s on her knees with her ass in the air, if he grabs her ankles to spread her legs further apart, good good good. But all of your descriptors will have to be pulling their weight in the scene. If you’ve already gone over how huge and bouncy her tits are, the reader doesn’t need to be reminded unless something about them changes. (I’ll talk about Flow in another post.)

**EXPECTATIONS VS REALITY:** You and your reader are both aware that a fictional sex scene written for erotic enjoyment and \*actual sex\* are two very different things. But a great sex scene is one that your reader can relate to, one that feels real. How much “real” detail-- prophylactics, lube issues, rope-pushing, cramping, queefing, farting, gagging, cervix poking (ow), Santorum, and various other coitus interruptus-- should you include in your scene?

The answer? Some.

It really depends on what kind of scene you’re going for. Are the two lovers finally coming together for a moment of divine, perfect bliss? Don’t stress too much about the weird noises a vagina makes when you ram something into it too hard.

Are you writing something that’s meant to be awkward and bumbling? Go ahead and include the bit where the one on top has to stop to catch his breath because his back and thighs are on fire, and the one on bottom has noticed that the pillow they’ve been biting is the same color and fluffiness as a saltine cracker.

There was a trend when I was a young fanficcer that if you were writing an anal sex scene (or a Lemon, as we onion-belters called it), you HAD to point out that your characters were using lube and you HAD to use safe and correct lube or you were Doing It Wrong.

In real life, yeah you absolutely should be using lube when shoving something up your butthole. But in fiction? It’s assumed that unless you go out of your way to say something about it, preparations have been made. If it is IMPORTANT that your story include one of these details, if it ADDS to the scene, then go for it. If not, most readers will forgive you for leaving it out.

(Also, remember that your audience is not Everybody Who Can Read. It’s People Who Like the Stuff You Write. If your virgin girl is wet as a slip-n-slide and loves the feel of a gargantuan cock and can do spins and flips and shit during sex, someone is into it. Remember, it’s fiction. Just make sure that the runup to your Maiden Gymnast’s performance makes sense. Otherwise, ignore the haters. I will go into Fictional Stuff That Doesn’t Jive in Real Life in the taboo post.)  


I wrote a scene between a virgin and his more experienced partner, doing butt stuff for the first time. I wanted to put emphasis on the virgin’s inexperience and his reaction to new sensations as well as his partner’s competence, so I made sure they had lube and went very slow.

I also have a long-running series featuring a male prostitute who somehow manages to have like fifteen orgasms a day and gets fucked in the ass by nine men a night but doesn’t have to get up and walk around bow-legged for the rest of the time.

If you are writing an erotic scene, and especially in the Rising stage, Hotness should be in the driver’s seat, but you can have Reality riding shotgun.

**EUPHEMISMS:** Otherwise known as, “His throbbing meat wand.”

While “cock” is the most popular euphemism for the penis these days (and the one that I use most often), everybody has a preference, and once again the tone of your piece is going to largely determine what words you want to use for people’s junk.

In most circumstances you should pick the word you like most and stick to it. If you’re gonna call a vagina a pussy in one paragraph, don’t start calling it a cunt in the next unless there’s a clear reason to do so. If he’s fondling her tits, don’t soften the word to breasts in the same encounter.

I am going to keep insisting that there are no hard and fast rules for writing, so yes, there may be a circumstance in which you start using terms like “hot beef injector” and “yogurt cannon” and “honey hole” and “poop chute” to describe different parts of the human anatomy.

I can’t think of any right now.

When choosing euphemisms you’re also going to want to think about whose perspective you’re writing from and what their attitude is toward their partner and during the encounter. I have a character who’d been conditioned to view women solely as sex objects, and when describing a woman in his voice, I talked about her tits, her cunt, her asshole, etc-- harsh, vulgar words for a harsh, vulgar viewpoint.

Is your scene going to be rough and loud? Find matching euphemisms. Are your characters coming together in an act of adoration and worship? Try softer ones.

In the long-running series I mentioned earlier, the main character obviously encounters a lot of penises in his day to day life. While he mostly thinks of a penis as a “cock,” occasionally I’ll use a different term, like “erection,” depending on what kind of encounter I’m setting up. Main Character will only think of an erect penis as \[his\] “erection” if I want to underline that the penis was flaccid before and it’s become, or in the process of becoming, hard.

In the same series, Main Character will use different euphemisms for sex to indicate to the reader how he feels about each encounter. A dominant older man “fucks” him (Main Character also “fucks” shyer, more submissive characters). His clients and his master “use” him. When he has sex with a person in a gentle, passionate encounter, they’re “making love.”

Make whatever words you choose, work for you.

**METAPHORS** (and similes): I’m not gonna go into how or why you should use metaphors; I’m going to assume you already know what they are and how they work, and you can make your own choice of how often to use them.

With something like sex, which is so often compared to… like literally everything (dancing, battling, coming together, coming apart, hunting, conquering, the list goes on and on and on), it’s tempting to use a bunch of great metaphors to add weight and meaning to the scene. And you should!

But when you’re choosing things to liken your sexual encounter to, make sure to first ensure that the imagery you’re invoking matches or at least has something to do with the rest of the story, and second, choose a theme and stick to it.

If your character is a devout priest who has fallen for a beautiful woman, he might see her as a goddess, as sublime, her hair a halo and her body an altar at which he worships (hi Hozier) or his sanctuary. Their lovemaking is an offering to the heavens, and his climax is absolution.

A character who is having sex with a rugged, muscular mechanic might compare his lover’s cock to a piston, his grunts and panting breaths to the huffing of an engine coming up to speed. He might marvel at being handled with the same gruff competence as the mechanic affords his projects, and if you’re feeling saucy you can make a dipstick joke.

If her orgasm is an explosion, it probably won’t also be a cup spilling over-- one indicates the destruction of something and the other is the overfilling of something. However, you can start with the overflowing cup and then ramp it up to a dam bursting, because one is related to the other. If you’re going to go the route of describing semen as “seed,” your readers might be waiting for the rest of the “sowing” symbolism.

If someone is sucking a cock and it empties itself, painting him with ropy, salty seed like flechettes from an antipersonnel missile, and this scene takes place during the French revolution, your reader is going to stop reading and go “wait, what the fuck?”

(addendum: if you don't want to use your metaphors to ENHANCE the prose, at least try not to choose ones that will DISTRACT your reader from it.)

Something like that is going to interrupt the FLOW of your scene, which is what we’ll talk about in a future post. Next time: Taboo Subjects.

**AGAIN:** Questions can be put into the comments and I'll try to get to them. If you've come here to make fun of me just know that I read those comments out loud to my family in funny voices and then we all laugh and talk about how much you suck.

I am writing in English because it's easier to get help, resources, a wider audience in case I self-publish, etc...  The problem with it is that some of my family members do not speak english. I was thinking it's kinda sad but then I'm not sure they would like my genre of writing anyway. (fantasy)

I thought maybe I could write a translation in my native language and, if I self-publish, release both at the same time. The problem is of course the huge amount of work + I'm sure I will want to change things which will make me want to revise the story.

I know people who only speak English who won't be able to read my story in my native language so I can I can't please everyone.

I was thinking that these people probably won't like the type of story I write or maybe it could be a motivation to practice English.

Does someone else have this kind of problem? Did Someone lived this situation? I just want to know what you think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Wow thanks for all the comments. I never had more than 6 comments on a post before I was surprised. Interestingly there is a lot of different opinion on the subject. I haven't finished my draft but I'm close to the end. I guess I will have to see what to do at the end. I will probably publish it in English then if the seems to be interested in my native language's relatives then I could try to translate it. I'm still scared that my translation will become a revision. I will also need someone to look for my mistake in my native language.

Thanks for all your comments I can't reply to all of you but I appreciate your input."

-Predictable outcomes; it can get tiring having certain characters in certain situations, since you know the characters will survive in the original story. 

-Contradictions in motivations and plot.

-Adding new characters/events that aren’t mention until after the prequel is released.

-Trying to imply greater meaning to certain characters and relationships.

-Tying as many loose ends introduced in the prequels too quickly while leaving a huge gap for the main story.

-De/myth events

-Clashing character motivations from the prequel and the main story.

**Here's what I got for what a character is:** A character is the personification of a collection of traits based on a theme.

I think that by deciding on a theme that a character is supposed to personify, the other aspects will fall into place.

**Say you have the theme (or premise)**: Self-forgiveness is the first step to becoming a better person.

**Then coming up with a character arc would be simple**: A shitty person who hates themself learns to accept and forgive their past so that they can move on to being a better person.

And once you have the arc you can probably figure out a bunch of other stuff like:

**want:** to forget the past or drown out the pain it causes.

**need:** to accept the past for what is

**maybe the lie that they believe could be:** Mind-altering substances are the only possible respite from the pain of the regret of the past (and then this would refine the arc)

**Flaws:** addict, self-hate, anti-social

**redeeming qualities**: \[throw in some to balance out the flaws\]

So basically aspects to make a character are:

**theme**

**arc**

**lie they believe**

**want**

**need**

**flaws**

**redeeming qualities**

Does this sound good. Is there any you'd remove. Any you'd add. Am I making sense? Am I talking out of my ass?

There are three parts to it. One part deals with the main character, the second part deals with the main character in an alternative reality and the third part combines the characters.

\-The second one is about dealing with childhood trauma. While the trauma is hinted at, the focus of the novel is dealing with the impact of it as an adult. It's fiction but based very closely on my life.

\-The third one which I have just started is about a humanoid and a robot that were created to serve and to kill respectively but they would rather just drink coffee and sing anti war songs. 

I am a little embarrased about writing them and I have not shown them to anyone so far. I failed English in high school and this has made me very selfconcious.

Note - I'm absolutely not suggesting anything nefarious has happened here. It's just a weird (and slightly frustrating) anecdote that serves as a good reminder to finish what you start. 

Trigger warning - suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 years ago I bought life insurance - was a strange process - but during this I jokingly asked what would happen if I committed suicide and if my family would still receive the benefit. I was told that there is a clause that stops exactly this from happening, and that I would have to wait 13 months before doing anything.  


So, of course this sounded like a fantastic idea for a film. I wrote a 5 page outline over a few days, about a man who just couldn't deal with life anymore, but wanted to provide for his family. So, after getting this insurance had to wait out the year until he could commit to his deed. With the release of knowing it would all be over soon he opened himself up to experiences in his life that he hadn't beforehand and lived more complete and fulfilled than he ever had. Cue a downturn at the end of Act 2, a redemption in Act 3, and we're done. I called it ""13 Months"", wrote out most of Act 1, but then a paying job came along, and I bottom shelved the project to pick up later.  


6 years later... Just saw an article about Will Forte's new series ""Expiration Date"" a couple of days ago. Some of you might already know about this, but I'll post the synopsis below...

&amp;#x200B;

""Per the show’s description, Forte will play Robin, a suburban man “who, consumed by grief, finds a life insurance policy that covers suicide, provided that the individual doesn’t carry out the deed within one year. Content that his family will be provided for, Robin sets his expiration date and contemplates how he will spend his final year. It’s going to be a long 12 months.” ""

&amp;#x200B;

Ouch. Oh well. Let this serve as a reminder and a motivator to you all. Get those projects out of that drawer and finish them now!

Thing is, if I try to aim for that, my writing is actually really bad some days. Like I've just written it for the sake of writing that day. Or if I don't write for whatever reason, lack of motivation or time, I feel like an absolute failure, regardless of what's already been achieved. I'm currently on 40k words into a first draft of a novel, and the days it works, it's great. But on the days I'm forcing myself to do it, it's a bunch of crap that I know I'll have to delete anyway. I also feel like it needs to be a respectable amount of words, like at least 500-1000, otherwise it doesn't seem like much of an effort. I know, even bad writing makes you better, but what's the point if it's going to be deleted/completely changed?

Shouldn't the advice be 'write most days'? So that it's consistent but not super imposed? Or is it individual? I just feel like it's not doing some of us any favours. I get why you should aim to do it every day - so that you maintain your creative muscle or whatever. But does it really go that weak if you skip a day or two here and there to regroup and gain a fresh perspective?

I'm really not making excuses. I love writing and I'm happy to do it most days. But sometimes it's like being full and someone is forcing you to have yet another piece of that heavy chocolate cake. And you know how that usually ends.

1943,FallyWaffles,Discussion,4,writing,1615929121,"Applying Save the Cat Writes a Novel to the Protagonist (long post!) Good evening!

This might be a long one, so buckle in if you're sticking around!

Last week I picked up a copy of Save the Cat Writes a Novel by Jessica Brody, and it's looking great so far for working out plot points and pacing. I think it's going to be really useful.

I'm having a couple of teething problems in part one(!) and I wondered if anyone else had similar experiences and could shine a light on it.

Basically, the first part where you establish your hero and what their biggest problem/their ""shard of glass"" is.

The prompts that Brody gives are ""what does your character want? How do they think they can achieve it, and how do they think it will fix their life?"" ""What does the character *actually need*, how will it *actually* fix their life?""

Now, I'm pretty sure I'm focusing on the right character for the ""hero"" of the story, so I'm not worried about that. The issue I have is that he doesn't seem to fit into the mould set by the hero-making exercises in this part of the book.

For context, the protagonist is called Marko, he's the  reluctant emperor (figurehead, a bit like the Queen in the UK) of a large empire after the untimely death of his older brother. He feels he's living a fraudulent life and was never cut out to be an emperor. He's a pacifist at the head of a nation that's ready for war with a rival empire, but given that he's just a figurehead monarch, he's pretty much powerless to do anything about anything. He's a very compassionate person (and already had his Save the Cat moments before I picked up that book).

He coasts along with his life, shaking hands with dignitaries and opening new theatres, until he meets the new ruler of the rival empire in a token peace talk, and long story short, they fall head over heels for each other. So together, they manage to push the two nations toward peace, but their governments still want to eradicate each other, so the peace is delicate and they have to be careful. The first domino falls when there's an assassination attempt after their clandestine affair is discovered, and to jump forward right to the end, both empires are dissolved into democracies and the two gain their freedom to live how they want without the trappings of being royalty.

So regarding Brody's prompts, (what does he want? what does he think will fix his life?) are sort of irrelevant until the big cataclysm happens, because he is powerless to do anything. If he and his paramour both abdicate, there'd be war. They can't be openly together, there'd be chaos. Marko makes the difficult decision to end it because the situation is untenable, but that ends up knocking over the first domino and causing the big upheavals which ultimately allow him to be free at the end.

So yes, Marko wants something, but he can't do a thing about it until fate steps in and turns the situation upside down.

(IF YOU'RE STILL READING THIS, WELL DONE, AND THANK YOU!)

That's it essentially, and it's quite difficult for me at the moment to squeeze him into this hero template. He can't actually pursue his goals or strive toward anything until the Big Bad happens. Does this make him a weak protagonist? Do I just ignore Brody's coaching and plough on anyway?

Any input much appreciated, and sorry for bending your ear (eyes?) for so long."

When I sat down to write the other night, I wrote a very interesting and introspective chapter that is full of subtext, zingers, varied sentences, colorful descriptions and personality. Then yesterday I was writing a scene that was a million times more interesting in theory but it fucking sucks and no matter what, whenever I return to it I can’t make it anywhere near as good as that previous chapter and it always feels almost unreadable.

The good chapter was just about a meth dealer sitting in a Waffle House, looking over a mailed tarot reading a month late (so he’s trying to figure out if the predictions came true) while reflecting on how the uncle that sent him the reading molested him once, and what human contact really means to him. Boring shit in theory, but I was throwing seven different kinds of smoke, and was on my A game. I even included Tom and Jerry lore in the chapter in a darkly comedic sort of way. 

The shitty one was in theory supposed to be incredibly fun and exciting. One of our protagonists is high on ecstasy running for her life from a meth head with a crossbow, comes across a game of beer pong on a nearby lawn, and gets the players to beat the shit out of her pursuer. It’s so stiff that the only enjoyment that can come from reading it is just seeing what’s actually happening in the scene, not any of that colorful artist telepathy that’s supposed to engage the reader. The prose is trash. 

Each chapter was a little under ten pages, and the full book should be around 150. I desperately want the whole thing to be written like the Waffle House chapter and not the beer pong chapter but I’m really scared that it can’t be helped, and the whole thing will be a dumpster fire."

I believe generally in keeping your work private, so I haven’t told anyone I know about this in real life... but I’m writing a novel. And I’m fuckin’ pumped about it. 

There’s a clear vision for the world and setting in my mind. It’s a historical revenge novel set in the early Middle Ages. A beast of a book. The outline frightens me if I look at the entire thing in scope. And it’s wonderful. 

I grew up writing books. I was something of a prodigy as a kid. I pounded out three novels before I was thirteen and had publications, honours, etc. Then I fell in love with theatre and spent ten years furiously writing as many plays as I could and forgot about prose entirely. The next book always ended up at the bottom of my to-do list ... and that list is long. 

Theatre is phenomenal fun to write, as there’s an added liveness to the text — your characters emerge out of the page fully formed, embodied by actors. But it’s also limiting as a form. No massive set changes, a reduced scale for visual effects, smaller narrative scope so the audience can grasp it, fewer characters to save on budget, etc. 

My novel is the opposite. It’s a behemoth of a book, featuring will be, dozens of characters, numerous villages, cities and homesteads across a vast territory. Historically accurate weapons, armour, infrastructure, economies and social hierarchies. Accurate depictions of duelling, siege combat, black smithing and forging iron weapons. Enormous length — a massive revenge tale with a tapestry of themes. Political conspiracies, class warfare, violence, sex, feasting, jousting, adventures, brutal depictions of warfare and suffering... my book will have all of it and more, if I ever finish the damn thing, and if I can pull it off.

It has me grinning like a dog. 

I know people like Sanderson and Martin make it look easy but handling this much material is incredibly challenging. I’m through page 300 of around 1000 planned, and I’m already drowning in information. Overcoming that challenge and getting it all down on the page is the first goal. The rest is up to editing and luck. 

Just wanted to share this news with someone who won’t bug me about it, or ask me when it’s done, or when it’ll be published, or why it hasn’t sold a million copies yet. (Maybe one day it will, who knows. /s)

I’ll post again when it’s done. Till then...

Even though I know that not everyone is going to love all aspects of my writing, I really hate how people act like in order to have a formidable female character she has to be as stereotypical masculine as humanly possible. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with having a female character who has a lot of male associated traits but I’m sick of that being the only view of female “strength” presented in literature. 

A woman can have strong maternal instincts, be ‘soft’ and feminine, and be girly and still be powerful as hell.

I don’t want to spoil everything but the reason why I made the character a stay at home mother in the first place is because she’s the last of her race and because of the abuse she suffered hates using her powers and has trust issues so she focuses on raising her child who belongs to a dying race.

Now it's time to start working and see where it goes.

I run an Internet Marketing community which I'm going to focus on promoting and growing more heavily and try to generate inbound leads for business owners looking to inbound market online. I think it's a good fit sharing and demonstrating my knowledge in Internet Marketing to find companies and individuals looking to hire a Content Writer and  Marketer.

I also have a passion for Self Development and Entrepreneurship and run blogs where I post weekly on these topics. I have added links to my Content Agency on these websites too in case they might also generate potential work.

2021,Unicorn_Bro,Other,3,writing,1617673163,"An original story I wrote. I just wanted some criticisms on what I could do better. Title: Gestorben 
I love my new job. Not that would be a difficult thing to to get from me. It’s only the second job I’ve ever had, but this job is amazing and while I’ve only been here for a little while I already know that this is my dream job. 

Although this might just be from my previous experience... My last job made me go through a lot the night that I quit and it was nothing that anyone could’ve controlled. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same.

I was working retail at the time and it was fine I guess; especially for a first job or so I was told. I was stuck with the night shift and It was slow like every other night shift. We never got any customers during the night other than your classic crazies that would be walking into that place at night. 

I was sitting at the register trying to pass the time as the internet usually went out every night so I could t use my phone. I had finished just finish an internal rant in my mind about how dumb being open during the night was when the tv suddenly turned on in the store. 

I went to it after I got the remote to change the channels since it was playing static and I wanted to watch tv. I was going to leave it on though since they dont let us turn on the tv during the night to save electricity and I would just be able to blame the tv playing on this glitch.

I walked over to it and changed the channel when this random game show came on. I thought that if I kept on changing the channels it would be more obvious that i was purposefully not turning the tv off and it looked entertaining enough so I let it play. 

The tv show looked like it was from another country yet it was fully in English and it didn’t seem like it was dubbed. The show was called gestorben and the host was this crazed looking guy in a green suit and almost bulging eyes and he spoke:

“Welcome everybody to another episode of Gestorben!” “In tonight’s episode we look at our new contestant! One with passion and determination. Caste in your bets now wether you think he will win or not.”

He talked odd like a cartoon character with sudden outbursts of energy before sounding like he did t want to be there and he got energy at what seemed to be the wrong places in his lines, yet always with that creepy smile on his face.

That was when I noticed that the show had cut to a live feed of me from one of the cameras as the man said “If you haven’t voted vote now because time. IS ALMOST OUT!”

My heart sank looking at the footage. My mind raced with explanations for this before settling on the fact that we had somehow been hacked. The cameras pointing at me specifically, the tv turning on randomly, and this random show that I’ve never heard of before. All signs were pointing to the store being hacked.

I stood up and ran to the doors and tried to open them, but the doors were on close mode. A feature that the doors had installed to keep people out that seemed like a threat. I couldn’t see the irony of the situation before the man said “Alright. Voting time is up! Let’s see how our hero will prevail.”

I grabbed my chair and went to try to break the door with a chair when all of a sudden I saw a man outside the doors watching me silently. Only looking up for a second to reveal a gun at me.

“That’s not going to get you anywhere hero!The only way to set sail is to prevail.”

I slowly backed away and turned back at the tv when the man said:

“Alright. Your first task is simple and easy! Don’t open the employees room door! Your timer starts now.”

As I saw a 5 minute timer go on screen I began to hear muffled screams coming from inside. It sounded like my boss.

“Let me out of here you freak shows! Let me loose!”

My heart began to race and I yelled 

“ hey whatever your name is what happens to my boss if I don’t save him”

“The names Gestorben and the bigger question is what happens to you!”

A laugh track played I look back at the door to see that man still standing there. 

“Is somebody out there!? Get me out of here! I have money if that’s what you want.”

I began to think about wether or not I should open the door when 

“4 minutes remaining! Looking good.”

That’s when the screams got louder.

“Please somebody help me! I’ll do anything!”

I new that beyond that door something horrible must have just been revealed to him in there.
My mind was racing thinking about the morality in this situation and before I knew it.

“3 minutes remaing. This is where it gets tough!”

My Veins ran cold and my mind went blank as I heard a saw begin to run.

“SERIOUSLY HELP! PLEASE ILL GIVE YOU ANYTHING!”

My mind was running static, my emotions were everywhere, as I stood still as a statue. The screams of my boss not stopping.

“2 minutes left! This guy is resilient.”

The saw began to slowly get louder along with my bosses screams. I started to panic thinking about the fact that his life could really be in my hands. I couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t bear to keep hearing his voice when the buzz saw went quiet and heard my boss whisper

“Thank you” 
Before 

“1 minute.”

The saw suddenly started again louder and faster! I didn’t know what to do. My boss started screaming again. The saw getting louder fast.

I started to consider everything. My life and his. Thinking about my future and his. I couldn’t take it anymore. Then I collapsed to the ground crying. 

“30 seconds.”

I slowly rise and grab the door handle about to open it before thinking to myself that I hold more value then him. I mean after all I am more young and still have my life ahead of me ... and he was old and he had lived all of his life. His kids had already moved out and his wife had already died and my parents siblings and friends were all still here so it would be less impactful if he died right?

“10
9
8 ...”

I slowly backed away as the count down ended.

“3
2
1
ZERO!”

I heard my boss scream from the inside until he stopped. A few seconds after the saw stopped too. And a small golden pin half covers in blood came out from under the door.

“Take and wear it with pride! There’s only two more pins until your reward!  Let’s move on to our next game.”


“Next up is a slightly more difficult game! Restock the shelves before time runs out.”

I began moving as soon as I saw the timer with only 3 minutes thinking that it would be a waste of a life if I didn’t make it out alive. I knew this store like the back of my hand and easily put all of the items back when

“2 minutes left.”

I started to panic so I shouted “am I right?”

“The timer will stop when you’re right!”

I ran to the item thinking about what could be wrong when I noticed that the cans said in small text Gestorben and I realized that these weren’t the real tags. I ran peeling the tags off and seeing what the real items were. Running I put them all on the right spots when

“1 minute! While he prevail?”

I ran thinking what could be wrong looking though all of the cans one by one. Making sure that it was on the right spots.

“ 30 seconds.”

I was nearing the end when I noticed that I didn’t fully take off the tags of some of them and realized that it must be what was wrong. Quickly peeling off thefake stickers as Gestorben counted down 
“10 
9
8 ..”

I barley finished at five during the count down when he announced.

“Good job. Everyone who voted that you would win must be ecstatic right now. Will we have our winner?”

I bent down to to pick up another pin that came out of seemingly no where.

“Your next task is to wait for the timer to end.”

I noticed while getting up that there was a slight hatred of his voice when all off a sudden I fell to the ground with my right shoulder hot. I realized I had just been shot by that man outside even though I was behind a shelf and you couldn’t clearly see me. That’s when I heard 5 more shots and then the sound of a gun hitting the floor.

I stood up when I made eye contact with the man. He had a similar crazed look in his eyes like Gestorben and he had a clever in his hand. I took one last glance to see a 7 minute timer this time barely at 6:30. When he took a swing at me.

I dodged barley with the skin of my teeth and I began to run. The man ran after me catching up rather quickly. I knew that this was not his first time doing this. He swung again and again and again each time I barley dodged. I noticed that he wasn’t going for something that would kill me like my head or chest, he was going for my limbs. What the hell was this guy trying to do to me! 

I ran in between the shelves pulling down on them to knock them down. He caught up with me and sliced my right arm. He didn’t fully cut through it, but cut a good bit down, almost hitting bone. The adrenaline gave me just enough strength to know the shelf down, trapping us both. 

I looked up at the timer and saw only a minute left. I sighed in relief when suddenly the weight on my chest began to be lifted and I turned to the man slowly pushed up the shelf. My heart began to race and began to try to escape, but the cut on my shoulder was to painful to push myself to my feet. The man drew closer but before he could slice me his body fell limp on top of me. I looked outside and saw another man with a gun who looked much more sane. He simply got back into a car and left. In the blood of the crazy man there was the final pin. I shouted

“Hey i beat your game now let me out of here!”

“Congratulations you can now claim your prize!”

He shouted. All of the joy in his voice gone with only anger left. The doors went open and I sighed in relief at the end of the night when I saw the same green suit that Gestorben had put on. I turned back and yelled

“Is this a joke!”

But was greeted with only static on the tv.

What I did next probably isnt a surprise. After all I love my new job. I only have to work once a month and I get to see idiots fumble around and fail at everything. I love my knew job. I really feel it’s my true calling.

2029,Westerlyn,Advice,12,writing,1617670978,"Please help me understand how much I should limit to-be verbs. I don't want to fill this post with links, but a quick search of either this subreddit or google unearths lots of discussion about to-be verbs (was/were etc). Some argue that they're bad writing and to never use them. Many more argue that limiting yourself like that is stupid. The consensus, which I agree with, is that to-be verbs have a place in writing and to use them when needed. I'm just getting hung up on when, exactly, I need to use them. In theory almost any sentence can be reworded to exclude them.

I understand why this advice exists. ""She was running"" is almost always less evocative than ""she sprinted"". Passive voice has a time and a place, but ""the ball was thrown"" probably isn't one of them. Those are both basic examples and easily edited. Removing 'was' from something like ""he was going to be late"" isn't as simple, but even this could be expanded into a scene where the big meeting starts at nine and the guy is stuck in traffic. Show, don't tell and whatnot. I'd probably use 'was' a few times within that scene, though, and this is where my mind starts to spin.

I've been struggling to come up with any examples because, again, almost anything can be reworded to avoid 'was' if that's your goal. I'm just not sure how hard I should be trying to avoid it in the first place. If I grab a bunch of books from different authors off my shelf and flip to random pages, even excluding dialogue, was/were aren't exactly hard words to find. I'm afraid this is a piece of advice meant to convey ""don't say 'he was angry', you dummy"" and maybe I'm taking it too far. I spent the weekend going through my current project doing my best to remove 'was/were' and wound up with a bunch of sentences I honestly liked better before I did anything. Given enough time and enough sentence torturing, I'm sure I could excise more. But should I?

Any wisdom on this topic would be much appreciated. Some random writing blogs say not to worry about it at all, others say I can only use two or three was's per page but only if I absolutely must."
2030,Tony00237, ,28,writing,1617670318,"How do you awkowledge character development without it being telling? I feel like i'm going to be slapped for content posting and told to move to brainstorming for including a example but i seriously believe this is a technique question and im only using the example to show what i am referring to. Sorry in advance if im still deemed wrong.

So at least in this sub reddit there is a big emphasis on subtly in writing and showing not telling. That's cool and good and something i personally subscribe to. Thing is at some point it feels important for characters to recognize they have changed as people. 

It helps put the book in some context, draws attention to the journey, and in my opinion invites the reader to reflect on the character. Thing is i dont see a way for a character to say ""yes i guess i have changed"" or something to that effect without that being the character telling something.

For example in my current project i show they change. One character goes from a abused shut in who is scared of adults and clingy and obedient to anyone who shows them an inch of kindness. They develop over time gradually putting up more and more resistance until eventually they leave their partner, face down their parents, and pushes back against their best friends bad idea. This is development that is shown which is good. 

Then at one point during the confrontation at the very end of the book with their family one of the parents remarks that they have changed and are a terrible child. It makes sense in the book as it has been a month since the parent has seen them and the character is very different from the last time they saw each other. The character admits yes he has changed but he isn't terrible and that it was necessary. This is at the very end and is telling that he has changed which is bad.

My question is this then.

How do you have a character awkowledge they changed without it being them telling?"

They seem really great, and I know other authors who have published their stories through them as well. 

I received the contract, and based on my research, a lot of it seems fair (they get exclusive rights to publish for 12 months, 6% royalties, I retain the rights to my story). 

One thing I have not been able to find information on is when royalties should end for an anthology. The contract says I get royalties for 2 years after the publication date.

Is this normal since I retain the rights to the story? Or weird because they can keep selling the anthology after 2 years without me getting anything? 

I imagine the shelf life for an indie press anthology isn't very long anyways but I'm curious if anyone has experienced anything similar.

I know that you create a new paragraph when a new speaker says something, but what do you do if they just nod, sigh, or some other action like that? It's obviously not dialogue, but it's filling the space of where potential dialogue could go.

I'll use some examples to demonstrate: 

**Example 1**

*Jenkins nodded.* 

*“And somehow you got separated at the circus and ended up here? That's what it says on your notebook,"" and Rachel tapped the little book with her pen.*

I have recently discovered the 'Rising Man's novel and series of books by Abir Mukherjee with a very similar opening premise. I am of course going to buy and devour every word of those stories as the concept is really appealing.

Now my story plan is different from pure crime as it has strong horror/occult element but the opening premise is too similar to ignore.

My own PhD and immediate expertise is actually not in 20th century Calcutta but actually 18th century India and I wanted to set it in the early 20th century for the readers benefit.

So I guess I have 2 questions:

Have you ever had a plot that you realised was a copy of an already published work and what did you do?

Secondly, in my case, would you be more interested in a rejigged plot in the 1920's India setting or the original plot in the 1760's?"

Well, at least to me.

For example (this is according to Word's grammatical autocorrect blue lines):

Correct form: He gave her another smile and planted a quick kiss on her lips.""

Incorrect form: ""He gave her another smile, and planted a quick kiss on her lips.""

In my humble opinion, the incorrect form sounds way better in my head. If I was watching one person smile and kiss another person and was told to narrate it afterwards, I would say it with a pause. Specifically, right after the smile and before the and.

So, if I was writing that, wouldn't I write it with a comma to signify that pause???

I know that if I *really* wanted to use a comma, technically all I would have to do is this:

""He gave her another smile, and he planted a quick kiss on her lips.""

But...that's a bit too wordy for my liking, and doesn't roll off the tongue as easy.

So, what do you think?! Please refrain from being a grammar Nazi, I'm truly just curious as to what the ""correct"" way to do this is."

2079,RieifyuArts, ,4,writing,1617648624,"An issue with endless redrafting, comic writing, and an ungodly amount of time. So I've been writing a sizeable fantasy story that'll turn into a comic... At some point. I feel pretty confident in my narrative, character, and dialogue writing abilities, but my visual writing and descriptive skills are pretty lackluster. That'd make any book a slog to read even with good concepts. Pairing that weakness with my passion for drawing and design, a comic seemed to be the natural, most fun route to take.

I have no deadlines, nor any *real* reason to rush... but I've been writing this particular story for about six years. It was six years of doing it as a hobby through middle and high school, none of which is good at all looking back on it, but at a certain point last year I realized I want to take it seriously. I've spent the last year developing my skills and overhauling the poorly thought out world and characters of my past selves, and finally I've reached a point where writing a compelling, satisfying narrative with those pieces seems possible to pull off.

I want to have at least the first arc written to completion before I put stylus to tablet and begin drawing the comics first draft. My issue is, I'm much more of a pantser than a plotter. I *""watch""* my characters move through the story and present them with elements in a manner that guides them towards my major plot beats while keeping it entertaining. Then after some time has passed, I go through and reread it with a critical eye. On more than one occasion, I spot necessary improvements that require a sizeable amount of rewriting, dissecting, and shifting of the story. This takes quite a bit of time; And of course plotting would alleviate the issue, but it's so difficult for my mind to fill in the blanks between and actually follow through with the plan I set out with... I'd compare it to flicking a paper football into a wall-mounted target.

So my writing and redrafting style (a long process), with the goal of drawing a comic (also a long process), and my story (a very long story), all just adds up to a long, long, long, *long* process. I didn't set out expecting this to be fast by *any* means, but if it can be a bit faster that'd be nice.

**My question is:** Do you have any ideas on how to cut down on the ungodly amount of time this will take? I'm prepared to spend as long as it takes making something I can be proud of, but if any writers or comic creators can offer some advice for cutting down the process, I'd be eternally grateful to have heard it.

P.s. I apologize if it's a long post, but I figured better context would yield better advice. Thank you for checking it out!"

Beyond the question of how long should a flash fiction or short story be, what makes a ff and a ss (flash fiction and short story, I'm too lazy to write the entire thing) a ff and ss. Does there have to be a character arc? A full plot? Can it be basically a scene within a larger story but that can stand on its own? I'm mostly wondering for submissions and to see if my shorter pieces really apply for the submissions (in lit magazines). For example, I have a few short pieces (a couple thousand words) that don't have a full plot and that realistically, could be separate scenes within a novel (so it's not a story on its own, but it references past events, character relationships, etc). For example, one of them is a battle, a fight scene between two old lovers that are now fighting on different sides of the same war. We don't start at the beginning of their story, and it's referencing events and relationship dynamics ""before"" the actual story starts.

As part of the plot that I have in my mind, her poems get published. That's all I know for now. 

Please suggest a series of events/plot twists based on the following three things:

1. She doesn't pitch them. The poems reflect her internal conflicts and her dark secrets. 
2. The pseudonym under which she writes should have some significance.
3. A man loves her. She feels for him too but doesn't acknowledge her feelings. 

I don't want her diary to get lost on a train and be discovered by an editor. That's too easy.

2085,ShlSh0, ,5,writing,1617645920,"Question about writing from 3 POVs? I am planning a fantasy novel with 3 different POVs. All 3 characters have their own arcs and I feel very distinct voices. I really believe the story is benefitted by getting each of their different perspectives. Also, towards the climax, they end up in different locations. Some of the battle scenes I feel are aided by switching POVs as well since they will not always be in the same part of the action. 

Here is what I am possibly overthinking - I have been reading Multi-POV books to get a feel for the craft and how it's done and I've noticed that every one that I've read has an antagonist of some sort as one of the POV characters. Even in one that I read where everyone was working together, one of the characters was planning to turn on the others at the end of the mission for reasons they felt were morally justified. In my story, the antagonist is not one of the 3 POVs. All 3 characters are after the antagonist for their own reasons, and are teaming up to take them down. The closest thing I have to something like this is that the protagonist and one of the others do not get along. One of the three POV characters initially does not trust the protagonist and sabotages them in the hopes of getting them to quit, because they worry the protagonist is a liability and will cause them to fail at their goal. But by the third act, they are starting to form a friendship. 

I keep contemplating finding ways to make one of my 3 characters scheming in secret against the other 2, plotting to betray them/help the antagonist, because I am wondering if that would make the story more interesting, but it always feels a bit forced. Like I struggle to find reasons the characters would want to do this.

I wanted to know if anyone has any thoughts or advice on this. And if you know of any books that are similar, where there are 3 or more POVs without one belonging to the antagonist, I would love to know about it. I am trying to learn as much as I can about this before I finally sit down to write it. This is not my first novel but it will be my first time attempting multiple POVs."

For me, the purpose of a work is to TEACH, not entertain, not to propagandize. To be clear it MUST entertain to do its job but it's the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down. Symbolism in almost all cases is dishonest to the truth of people and how they function in the world. It's one of the reasons I hate lit fic (at least what I was force-fed in high school) so much from the readings I had do, I had to watch symbolically appropriate people who were as symbols incapable of learning or overcoming and by the end I was cheering for them to die because they were morons and often evil ones at that. For reference, Graham Green's Heart of the Matter, the Horse's Mouth, to a lesser extent a Passage to India. Also the Mayor of Casterbridge, but it was less wanting to see the Mayor die terribly as Thomas Hardy himself for subjecting me to that soap opera tawdry crap. It's a great story until the wife comes back, maybe until she gets sick....then it goes OFF THE RAILS. Oh and it's relentlessly cruel too, just cause.

None of the books I've read so much as mention this little detail, which I think is rather a big deal? I mean, I get it. These are fictional books, but even so, nobody bats an eye on the cops getting into a relationship with a witness.

My philosophy is that anything original is just an originally made amalgam of the creater's influences and that we unconsciously take inspiration from literary everything we consume. In my writing I use certain attributes (physical and psychological) of other characters when writing mine. A perfect example of that is my main character. Ive taken loads of inspiration from the Attack Titan from Attack on Titan when designing the features of my character (unique segmented jaw and teeth) but I've also taken inspiration from the Marvel universe in the sense that he has a mechanical suit of armor. My question is what do other writers think about this and are there any specific problems that arise when taking great influence from something and adding it to your writing?

**Narrative Essay:**

A drive I’ll never forget

We sprinted through the parking lot. Breathing hard I hoisted myself into the car.

“Drive.” Chris said getting into the car. I started the car but glanced towards Chris just to make sure he was fully seated in his seat. He was and slammed the door close then looked at me. “I said DRIVE!” he yelled. I reversed and recklessly drove out the parking lot and onto a small road.

“Are they following us?” I asked and was for some reason still yelling.

“I don’t see them.” He was also still yelling. I took a few misleading turns, before getting onto the Highway. Chris looked at me and said “You should have-“

“No. You don’t get to rip into me this time. That was *not* my fault.”

“I’d beg to differ.”

“What is your Problem?” I mean seriously hold your tongue.

“You really just didn’t handle that well, that and every other mission.”

“Oh, ok so I didn’t single handily get us out of that situation?”

“I didn’t need your help.”

I took a deep breath *I didn’t handle that well,* yeah sure. How much audacity do you need to be like Chris? “You know Chris you don’t have to stay; you can leave. Or I can make you, in more than one way.”

“You wouldn’t.”

“Really? The same way you said I *wouldn’t* get out of there alive, reality check I’m alive.”

“Thanks for the reminder.” He said sarcastically. “Now if you don’t mind what is you next mission that you’re no doubt going to mess up.”

I stopped the car. “Get out.”

“Come on…”

“Get. Out.”

“Zack, I was just messing around.”

“I should have known, you’re just like him always pushing buttons and then saying it was just a joke.”

“I am not like him.”

“Then what do you call this that you’re doing right now huh? Like I said GET OUT!” Chis Looked at me for the first time truly upset.

“I. am. Not. Like. him.” He said, opened the door, stepped out the car, slammed the door and stared walking next to the road.”

I rolled down my window and shouted “If you don’t want to be like him then don’t be like him. Don’t try coming back.”

I rolled up my window again and drove away."

The book itself is already on Amazon and definitely one of my better-reviewed novels. That being said, I was curious what everyone else’s experiences were like on this site.

I am writing a blessing to curse story about a man who is in his late 20's. He has mind reading powers, the more he used them the more he gets stuck inside his brain. He discovered his powers when he is in his teens and used them relentlessly.

Now to the present, he works a labor job getting paid below minimum wage, lives in a bad neighborhood and goes to a cheap bar after work.

He spaces out a lot almost half the time he loses touch with the reality.

One day he gets a very subtle sensation in his head, no other human would have noticed it, it was even hard for him who had been on the other side of the game for years to notice, his mind is being read.

Before he knows it he's on the run, he doesn't even realize who he is running from and who are these people he is with.

He was spaced out the whole time.

I spent the first couple of weeks figuring out the story. I was writing without a plot, just characters. And at the 30k word mark, I figured out how I wanted the book to end. I know how to get there. I can “see” the finished product.

But now that I’ve figured it out, it’s boring.

Does that make sense?

I find joy in starting with well-defined characters and uncovering their behaviors bit by bit. It’s a thrill to imagine how they would react to each other, and to their environment. What my characters do in the context of plot is less interesting to me as how they do it, and why. 

And at 30k words, I’ve built the characters, and I feel like I have nothing left to discover about them. I know the solution to the mystery, I know how it is revealed to the characters, and so it feels like there is no incentive for me to continue writing. The story is in my head. It feels finished. Writing the rest of it down just seems like needless tedium.

Meanwhile, I had this new idea. I’ve casually started worldbuilding, scratching out notes in a notebook, telling the story aloud when I’m alone in the car... New characters, new setting, new problems. New fire in my belly. 

But I’ve had this feeling before. It goes away when I finish the story in my head.

Then, there are two, maybe three other characters each with their own stories in the present, but also each with their own bizarre and/or shocking background stories which shape their perspectives and has some relation to why they’re regulars in this shit-hole of a bar. 

The perspective changes in the story so that you get dialogue from each of the different characters as if you’re observing them. 

Right now that’s it. I don’t have an ending yet. But I’m struggling to adapt this to the traditional methods of plot: boy meets girl and falls in love, man finds a secret and has to hide it from corrupt government officials, a protagonist travels to his hometown and learns something about himself, &amp;c. 

I don’t have this. Nothing really happens, but the characters are interesting. I don’t want to formulate some plot analogous to an action movie or a romantic comedy. It’s an analysis and deals with social anxiety and addiction and abuse and murder and recovery.

I’ve got a draft dating from 5 years ago, an edited version of it that I’ve done about 2-3 years ago. Completely unsatisfied with the story, I’ve decided to start over, change most of the story and change the POV from 1st person to 3rd person, so I decided to just start writing it as if the first versions never existed. 

I have found the weakness of my story, the point I’ve always struggle to write and that I still don’t know how to write: the part where my two main characters fall in love. I can write friendship, I can write established relationships. I’m struggling with the falling in love process. 

I have recently found out I’m asexual, and I think in a way it explains why I’ve been struggling so much with that part. I don’t experience sexual attraction, so how am I supposed to describe what that is? 

Knowing that now, I’ve googled “sexual tension”, “steps to fall in love”. It helped me a lot, but I still don’t know how I should pace my story. When does the feelings start? Do you know from the moment you meet someone you’re attracted to them? What goes into your mind? 

I want to get the falling in love part right this time, but I do feel lost because I don’t know what I should change or not. The characters met at the 2-3k words mark, and after 12k words the only hint at something more could develop is that one of them as been checking the other one out.

What I'm wondering is how to create non-human characters. The biggest possibilities are anthropomorphic animals, which either work really well, or are all cutesy, which isn't bad, but isn't good either. What I'd be going for would be something like Rango or Beastars, especially Rango. I want imperfect characters that are unique and memorable.

Another option is robots, but, no. I have a story with a few cyborgs in it going somewhere else.

Last thing is aliens, or some kind of non-human species. I don't know what to do with those. I don't want it to be too science-fiction, I could do that somewhere else.

Any other ideas? Advice?"

I'm working on a fantasy crime thriller (there is no magic), and I'm at the chapter, where the detective investigates the first crime scene. I'd like to build up the by splitting the chapter and make the crime scene more gruesome by leaving the details on the reader. This is how I want to do it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. chapter - The detective arrives at the crime scene. He sees a policeman vomiting and a different policeman is pale and is mumbling something about it that he won't get rid of the images for the rest of his life. When the detective looks at the dead body, he is in shock. Here I want to split the chapter
2. chapter - A young painter struggles with her life, and at some point during the chapter, she looks at a painting she made. On the painting is a sleeping girl wearing a simple carnival mask sleeping in a bed made from flowers. / This chapter takes 2 weeks before the 1. chapter
3. chapter - a short chapter from the murderer's point of view where he creates the crime scene. (He is using barbed wires to attach the flowers to the victim). At the end of the chapter he says for himself: ""Oh, I shouldn't forget the mask!"" / no description of the mask
4. chapter - Back to the detective - He struggles not to vomit and force himself to look at the murder victim. He looks at the body in detail (again, barbed wires and few details that I left in the 3. chapter), after that, he looks at the ""mask"". The mask is made from a different person's face.  /End of the chapter

I ran along the path of *Adelant* and tried not to bump into people or fall down. The street was narrow, and the road was full at lunchtime.
There was a flower stand in front of me, and a woman behind it tried to get the attention of the people by waving her hands and pointing to her flowers. After I walked past her, I turned to the right. The street became a little wider, I could see the cafe I was going to, and I could see three girls sitting in front of the cafe.

The first girl to see me had long blonde hair and pointed towards and tapped the girl in the next chair.
I was only a few meters away now, and two other girls my age started viewing towards my way
I waved at them and jogged towards them. I finally came in front of them and tried to kneel down and breathe. 

""Hey, I'm sorry I'm late!“

I got up and looked at my three girlfriends embarrassingly.

Florinne, a blonde girl, answered, carrying her bag and pulling out a box of cigarettes.

""Alright. But we ate your cake because you were too late.“

And pointed to the empty plate in front of her. The only thing left now were some crumbs. She leaned against the chair with a cigarette in her mouth.
""It's fine.""

And I hugged my friend to the right to greet her.
""Magnolia, have you forgotten what day it is?""“
Mavin asked me.

""No, no, no! Don't worry I know what day it is today.“
Mavin sat pulling one of the four chairs from the table. She took a sip of her coffee cup in her hand.
So I sat down with Mavin and turned to Brynn. She was holding a cup of coffee and drank from it. She wore a white hairband that fitted her white top, which accentuated her brown skin tone. The sunlight brightened her up more than usual, and her curly hair fell loosely over her shoulders.

""Stop smoking next to me.“

I looked at my friend.

""Breylanne I didn't lit the cigarette.""

""Don't call me Breylanne.“

I interrupted them bickering.

""Shall we get going?“

Mavin nodded, rushed her lipstick out of her pocket even though she had already had pink-reddish lips.
We all got up and went to the Adelant Library.
 
""Magnolia, you're wearing a nice dress today.“ 
Brynn said.

I felt fluttered and happy to hear that.

""It suits your top and your headband Brynn.“
Mavin said.

Florinne put her arm on my shoulder and said,

""Hey, I'm really curious about what new books are coming out. I can't believe this day has finally come. For years we've always read the same books.“

""That's it. The books are said to come from far away, and some school people speculated that individual books came from the 'Südliche Wende',"" Mavin answered.

""That doesn't make sense. There is nothing behind the south turn (Südliche Wende),"" I added.
Brynn asked: ""Are you sure?""

I shook my head and said: ""Guys. If you don't hurry, someone might come first, and the best books are gone.""

""You're then one to talk. You were late,"" Mavin said. ""It's okay, I'm sorry!“

I held hands with my friends and started running.
""Hurry up.""

So we ran down the narrow streets until we arrived in front of the Adelants library. Some people have already stood inside and looked through some boxes to borrow the most interesting books. Brynn opened the glass door and we went inside.

""The person who finds the book with the most interesting title wins, got it?,“Florin told us and went to go look through the first box.

Brynn followed her, and Mavin followed some other people.

The Adelant Library is very old, shabby and didn't provide much space, but I still experienced many beautiful memories here.

I like to read since I can remember, and as soon as I entered middle school, I got to know Mavin and Florinne. Because we all share the same interest, we decided to open a book club and visit the library every week. After that, we soon got to know Brynn. She sometimes came to the library and read books. And we found out she moved from Marlow to Adelant. So we became four best friends and almost always spent time reading books and exchanging stories with each other.

Years later, we were reading all the books the library could offer so far, and it was a surprise to learn that the library was supposed to be supplied with new books.

The library was open to all the residents of Adeleant, and the library was small, but there were many people, so there were not many books to choose from. Because most books were borrowed all the time.

""Magnolia, what are you doing? If you don't speed up you won't find a good book.“

Brynn snapped me out of it and realized how I was putting my hands in a box.

""Yes, you're right.""

I decided to put the box and Brynn behind me, and keep looking at the other end of the room. Because there were only a few people there looking through the shelves.

I went to one of the shelves, eyeing it and I checked the different titles. Until all of a sudden, something reaches my hand.

I turned around and a middle-aged man looked down at me.

""Oh, I'm sorry.“
He looked at me in surprise and took back his hand.
So I told him: ""It's alright."" 

I just wanted to turn around and go to the other shelf but he grabbed me by the arm and asked me,
""Have you found a good book yet?“

The man was quite tall, had black blond hair and looked at me through his glasses.
""Well, not yet,"" I answered.

""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm sure you'll find something interesting.“

He smiled at me and I freed my arm of his grip.
Not knowing what to answer, I nodded, picked up the first book next to me on the bookshelf, turned around, and returned to the most vibrant part of the library. I thought it was a really weird thing to say. And my three friends rushed towards me. 

""Magnolia, there you are!."" Mavin's calling.
""Oh, yes, and you have a book, too!,"" Florinne said.
I forgot I was holding a book, but Brynn picked it up before I even read the title.

„*weird title*""
My friends looked at the book and Brynn said,

""Interesting choice.“
And Florinne followed with: ""I think you lost Magnolia.“
She burst out laughing while Brynn giggled."

I didn't really know what to do next but I did the first step always recommended - put it away and don't touch it!

Then I read a book called Intuitive Editing by Tiffany Yates Martin, and oh wow did this help me out. If any of you are like me and want to be super organised and have steps for things to action or work on, this book is definitely for you. It offers clear advice but also is quite flexible and you can focus on what you need. It splits the editing stage up into Macro - Micro - Line.

Starting with the Macroedits, I did a full read through and cut my word count down to 78k by getting rid of all the fluff and useless plot lines that weren't doing anything, and also general rubbish. My ending was also a disaster, so I knew I had to change that. And then I built the novel back up using advice from the book, and as of half an hour ago I have my full second draft, still a little too long at 112k words but a much more cohesive story!

Next up will be the Microedits...but first a break again!

Just thought I'd recommend in case anyone was like me and was like first draft into second draft where do I even begin?? I feel much better about the whole thing now."

2200,TheBookshelfAuthor,Advice,44,writing,1620844103,"First chapters don't have to be hooks Greetings fellow humans. So, I've seen A LOT of posts recently on 'writing a good first chapter', and so, here's some advice I don't see touted often, but I've found very useful myself: your first chapter doesn't always have to be a 'hook'. That's what the blurb is for.

&amp;#x200B;

With the exception of web-based books, a first chapter doesn't have to be a hook. Your first chapter WILL hook, by virtue of what it should be, but that's not it's main function. It's main function is introduction. 

&amp;#x200B;

If your characters are the centre of your writing, then it's there to show them off. Show us what Billy does that makes him likeable, or dislikeable. Show us why he has a killer crush on Sarah. Show us how that impacts his relationship with his friends. If the main focus is a superhero, show us how that hero operates.

&amp;#x200B;

If your main focus is worldbuilding, show us the world. What makes this world weird and wonderful? How does the politics of this world impact the everyday man?

&amp;#x200B;

All I'm saying is, you don't need a fight-scene to hook your reader. You've already promised that on the back cover. You don't need snot and drama on the first page when you would be better of spending your time (and ours) telling us about the people who are going to star. Sure, if the main character is a gladiator, you can a have a fight, just know that it's not a necessity for the audience to keep reading. That's all."

For example, I’m trying now to write the opening chapter of a novel for a uni assignment. I’ve settled on the concept: a boy and his robot companion investigate the disappearance of his father, a robotics engineer.

I really liked the concept, but as I try to flesh it out, I’m finding an increasing amount of comparisons to existing material. Blade Runner, Terminator, Detroit: Become Human, Ex Machina, The Iron Giant, I, Robot, Bicentennial Man, Zima Blue etc. Every direction I take seems to have already been done and it’s incredibly frustrating. 

It’s hard to explain, but I feel this is different from writer’s block or lack of inspiration, which is why I made an independent post. I can get words on paper, and I can generate ideas, but none of it feels like my own.

Am I overthinking this? How do you write something that feels original, even if it is not? Any advice would be appreciated."

The forest was quiet and peaceful. No monsters or bandits in sight. All the kept the forest tranquil was a flowing river with water that any passerby couldn’t resist to drink from due to it’s bright blue color that glimmered in the sunlight. Some would say they felt rejuvenated after drinking yet it was merely due to the taste. The flowers as well added a safe aura to the forest for they as well shined regardless of where they stood. Lastly the playful sounds of the tiny drymites which roamed the trees and floated on the flowing river.

 

This place was perfect for Ezra to sleep. The young man laid his large frame of a body on the thickest tree he could find. His long bright red hair flowed down his head and shoulders so his neck wasn’t scratched by the bark. Ezra had left his hometown with only 3 important items. His tote bag with his favorite foods and other personal belongings. His red robe was imbued with his fathers crest that he wore over his battle shirt and pants of the same color. And his weapon. A large blade that was nearly as tall as he.

 

As the young man slept the drymites started to crawl all over him, and play within his hair and on his sword. Yet they all ceased their playing when they noticed another figure approaching the sleeping one. He was just as tall and wore a robe with the same crest on it. Yet he was pitch black. He knelt down before the sleeping young man and placed down an envelope on his bag. Then turned to leave. Not uttering a word to Ezra.

 

Soon he would awake, and once doing so all of the drymites scattered away from. Going back into the trees or the dirt or floating away on the river. Ezra shook his head to get any remaining off him and to fully wake himself, before kneeling before the water and drinking. He stood and found the envelope. He recognized the stamp immediately. Sighing to himself he stuck it in the pocket of the bag, yet it stuck out like a sore thumb.

 

Now that he had awoken and gotten back to his feet he could continue his real purpose for coming to such a beautiful forest. Finding the Crimson Mare. Ezra had heard stories of such a creature. A mythical horse that was as bright in color as his head of hair. With magical abilities unlike any other. Naturally that was his first stop after leaving home to find it. And he may have found it’s trail.

 

Right near him he found a small trail. The flowers lined up near the river, and they trailed away. While most were either the same or different, their existed a large spot of bright red flowers that lead more and more through the woods. He grabbed his sword and started to slowly follow the lead of the red flowers.

Ezra stepped lightly, though the water was not deep enough for him feet to even be submerged. He instead stepped over the flower because he considered them so beautiful.

I spend entirely too much time there, lol.  And about once a month, someone says, ""I really like how you approach this subject.  You should write a book!""  And - tbf - I also have people tell me I'm horribly offensive and weird, lol.  :)  

The problem is that I've freaking TRIED to pound some of my concepts into a book about 10 times over the last several years.  It always turns into a snake eating it's own tail within 20-30 pages and I walk away in disgust.  Rinse and repeat.  

I'm sure this is a common problem for writers and I'd love any recommendations about things that have helped.

Another problem I notice with my writing is I've been a blogger since before the word was invented.  And I think my brain is just nailed onto 2K word snippets.  In a blog or reddit, that can seem excessive.  But that's also a pretty skimpy book chapter!

Thoughts I've had:
1 - Go through all of this relationship complexity and pull out a central thesis as if I was getting my Ph.D. and basically write a thesis.
2 - Embrace the 2K format and write a collection of essays that are themselves organized into groups.  I've even considered using the basic problems that people present on reddit as essay topics.  Or making it a collection of Dear Abby posts.
3 - Just force myself to subdivide these complicated topics into their constituent parts and write about each separately (although this mostly defeats my basic idea that we are complete people with interconnected goals and motivations).  

Anyway.....would love to hear any thoughts before I go churn out another ~25 page mess.  :)"

Think Roman Empire. Slaves are a big part of the population, and the aristocratic houses are engaged in a whole lot of cloak and dagger backstabbing and double dealing.

The main character gets enslaved early on in the story, and spends the rest of the story bound to one of the noble houses. The twist is that this is a result of an attempt to inflict this fate on another character, which went horribly wrong. So her troubles are pretty much karmic.

Here's the other twist: She's not exactly happy about any of this, but she does work with her owners against the people trying to wipe them out: Partly because she's forced to, and party because she basically doesn't want a ship to sink while she's tied to the mast. She and her immediate owner come to something of an understanding as the plot progresses, acknowledging their similarities and the fact that each of them is behaving exactly as the other would in their position. The power dynamic never changes, but they do develop a certain respect, and a tentative trust.

At no point am I going to pretend that slavery doesn't belong in the dustbin of history, but in this setting it's just a part of everyday life, and no one has an actual problem with it until they're tasting if for themselves.

**But to my main point**: I just don't know what to do about skin colour in this story. I don't know what colour combination I can make the cast (both slaves and masters) without putting my foot down in SOME awkward spot or another. You know, since, among other things, I have an antihero who tries to enslave someone, gets enslaved in turn, cooperates with it, interacts with fellow slaves with varying attitudes to their plight, and forms something of a bond with her owner.

I guess I could just make everyone white and make the climate a lot colder than I intended, but that just opens one up to a different set of complaints. Especially when it's all set in a large realm with major foreign trade."

Hello, I just wanted to say a few words. When I was thinking of what I’d say about Shelly, I thought I might start with a quote. I read thru so many. But I kept coming back to one.

The quote is by Colin Murray Parks.
He writes, “The pain of grief is just as much a part of life as the joy of love; it is, perhaps, the price we pay for love, the cost of commitment.
It’s usually just quoted as ‘Grief is the price we pay for love’
I believe that is true for anyone that has loved someone. But especially someone you are in a natural covenant with. I’m speaking about a biblical covenant. You can choose to be in a covenant with someone. Like most of us do when we get married. But I believe that God puts us in a covenant with our birth parents. Because no matter what your relationship is like with your mother or father. You are emotionally tied together. There is a connection to them, like no other. Add love on top of that connection, it makes losing one of them painful almost physically. So maybe the cost of love is More than Grief. It a pain we have no word to describe it.
 

Shelly passed away very unexpectantly.  And without warning. But I am comforted, by the fact that Shelly is with her husband and son.

Even though I wasn’t as close with Shelly, as most of you. when my friends are in pain, I’m in pain also.

I may not have had a thousand hours with Shelly, but I’ve heard a thousand stories from her daughter. And honestly, she has been built up in my mind like a sort of character.  A funny East coast woman that has a passion for celebrity gossip and that’s right up my alley.

One of the first things I noticed about Shelly was that she did not hold back her feelings. She was a straight shooter, a tell it like she sees it type of woman. And whether we agree or disagree that type throws their beliefs and opinions right on the table. I love that in people. Many of the women in my own family share that trait.

She was easy for me to talk to, easy to chat with. The times I did talk with Shelly left me with the concrete impression that above all she loved her family. What her love ones may not know is that in those semi private conversations Shelly spoke very proudly of Stacey her daughter, And her grandchildren Anna and AJ. I could feel her love for you.

Shelly had a great sense of humor and a big beautiful laugh. When I was writing this, I was left with the feeling that I had missed out. I wish I had been able to know her more as a personal friend.

Even though we weren’t very close, I thank God for Shelly. Sometimes people deliver to you gifts without ever realizing it. For me, Shelly gave me what I can only describe as my most treasured friend. Her daughter Stacey.

And today that friend and her family are in such pain. And I’m sorry for your loss does not seem to cover it. But I am sorry. I am also grateful for having known her."
2272,qwerty083,Discussion,2,writing,1620803787,"How to identify a character's Lie/Truth? Hey everyone, I know that the Lie the characer believes is a very important part of the characer arc they will undergo, but I'd really appreciate some tips on how to identify a character's Lie (and subsequently the Truth they learn) in a story. Sometimes it seems like people have different interpretations of what that character's Lie/Truth is, but if it's written well, these interpretations should all (somewhat) relate to the Lie/Truth that was originally intended/written by the writer(s). So my question is: What are some tips on identifying a character's Lie/Truth?

As an example: For any of you that have watched the Netflix show Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts (SPOILERS AHEAD),  &gt;!I interpreted Scarlemagne's Lie as: Those who hurt cannot be forgiven. Of course, another lie he has is that all humans are trash, but I'm trying to focus on his more internal/personal Lie. Then over the course of the show, he learns that those who hurt (like he has) CAN be forgiven, as Kipo helps him realize that. How far off am I in identifying his Lie/Truth? And if this is only one of his Lies/Truths, is the one I described included?!&lt;"

* [Magical Native American Stereotype](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican)
* My world is very similar to various comic book worlds like those from Dc, Marvel, and Image comics, in that it is full of various superpowered beings

**Sources of Power**

* Superhuman Powers and Abilities
   * Come from a near near-infinite source of energy known as The Source
   * Powers can be inherited through a person's lineage
   * The energies of The Source were infused into the planet by a meteor that struck the earth millions of years ago
* Magic
   * Revolves around the manipulation of outer energies(primordial, alternate dimensions) and/or inner energies(Chi, psionic, etc)
   * Was created from trying to mimic Superhuman Powers
   * Ways people are able to acquire magical abilities
      * Enlightenment, Rituals
      * By being taught by other magic users and through training
      * From magical objects
      * Some people can use magic without any prior knowledge or training if they are descended from other magic users
* Like most fictional comic book worlds, my world's history is very similar to the real-world history, with one major exception in that Native Americans were able to hold onto a significant part of North American territory.
* **Ideas I Have To Explain This**

1. A tribe of Native Americans in the California region had a member born that had the ability to grant other Superhuman powers from the Source. As a result, many members of this tribe had Superhuman powers, allowing them to fend off settlers and hostile governments. Also, thanks to many of their members having powers. This tribe was able to advance their society beyond that of other civilizations of the time. Basically like a Native American version of Wakanda.
2. Various Native American tribes were able to band together and hold off settlers and the U.S. Government, mainly because they had a high number of powered individuals. My first thought was to explain this by having various Native American tribes achieve magical abilities through special, vision quest-like rituals they developed. However, I realized that this may play into the whole ""Magical Native American"" stereotype.

* Are these ideas okay, or would you say that they are offensive or stereotypical in some way? If they are offensive, what is a good way I could explain Native Americans have a higher level of powered individuals without falling into any stereotypes and that avoids misrepresenting Native American culture?"

Both men began to weep as they experienced a feeling of ineffable fear, listening attentively to the howling wolves get closer and closer by the second. Ulrich turned his head and peered at Georg, whose face was now covered by a concoction of his own blood, tears, and mud. 

Suddenly, the rustling of leaves and snapping of branches could be heard on both sides of the forest. 

""Ulrich?"" shouted an ebullient voice in the distance. 

Ulrich and Georg simultaneously turned to each other at once. With looks of hope in their eyes, they started to shout in unison. 

""Over here! Help!"" yelled the two men.

Three of Ulrich's foresters then emerged from the bushes and rushed to release their leader. A wave of relief washed through Ulrich and Georg. 

""We have been saved at last!"" cried Georg joyfully, ""thank the hea--"" but before he could finish his sentence, a flash, followed by a deafening ""BANG!"" tore through his forehead. Blood swiftly filled the wound, but life no longer filled his eyes. 

A fourth forester wielding a rifle in his hands was responsible. 

Rage quickly consumed Ulrich. But before he could get a word out, about seven of Georg's men arrived after being alerted by the sonic boom of the gunshot nearby. All armed with a rifle in hand, they spotted their master lying lifeless on the ground, and directly next to him, Ulrich Von Gradwitz. 

Without hesitation, all seven men began firing. A sea of bullets flew towards Ulrich and his foresters, killing all before they even had a chance to retaliate. 

In a forest of mixed growth somewhere on the eastern spurs of the Carpathians, several men stood solemnly one winter night, where the soil would be permanently marked with red."

Back in 2018, I was feeling bold and wrote a short and quick version of my book as a short story for a contest. Granted, I was not expecting to win. I wasn’t even expecting it to be mindblowingly good. At the time, it was just a fun way to get myself into writing it. Now, three years later, I’m feeling like its best for me to go back and reread it so I can scout for ways to improve, look for what I want to keep in the story (now that I’m writing the full length version) etc. The only thing is, I’m kind of dreading it because I know how my brain works. I’m gonna look at it and go, “I wrote THAT and sent it to a professional writing contest!? Yikes!”. Any advice, things to keep in mind when reading old writing, or lighthearted insight/stories of your own?

This is not a simple movie recommendation request. I am actively doing research for a creative project that will likely evolve from a series of stories/narrative-driven plots to a survival horror video game. I have been a fan of horror for a long time, but have become highly de-sensitized to it. It makes it difficult to conduct unbiased research projects to benefit my future creative endeavors. I am having difficulty not only finding things that scare me but also understanding the concepts that scare other people.

I am looking for recommendations on how to increase dread and terror in the audience. I know that a large part of this in the translation to the screen is going to be sound design, in addition to how to slowly build apprehension before the actual ""reveal"". I am hoping to see examples of this in film and video games that can be recommended to me that you believe show great examples of this. To eliminate some of the items that I am already familiar with, I will list examples below that I tend to draw inspiration from.

I look forward to any and all advice and research information to help me better develop my future work!

Inspirations I have drawn from (thinking off the top of my head):

* Video Games: Condemned, Outlast, Eternal Darkness, System Shock, Soma, F.E.A.R, Clock Tower, Layers of Fear, Fatal Frame, Phantasmagoria

Especially if the name has to make sense for the character’s “aesthetic“. So I have been making lore for my own original fantasy/sci-fi world, and one of the topics I’m most focused on is the Titans. The Titans are fragments of this divine entity that was very creative, but didn’t have the power to create like the other ”god” could. To say it simply, he has the image of the boat in his mind, but he doesn’t have the skill or materials to make it.

Long story short, this god and the other god got into an argument, and the entity got shattered into 8 main fragments and thrown down onto the world my book series is set in. These fragments became mini-gods that somewhat represent human/monster nature, and each claim different parts of the world as their territory. While their creation is unknown to be true, the Titans do exist with proof. They always bicker and provoke each other (most of them), and are very powerful deities in their own right.

The problem is that I don’t have names for some of them. These names are supposed to sound regal, but also alien. I would greatly appreciate any help with finding an idea.

1. The first letter of the name needs to be different with every name for the sake of keeping things interesting
2. It needs to sound like a name that a god or goddess would have

For reference, the current names I have are Niovarii, the Titan of beauty and manipulation, Yvallos, the Titan of logic and willpower, Leviathus, order and control, Xhulith, corruption and repulsion, and Zindol, deceit and mischief. Again, even a generator would be useful to help get the braincells flowing. I know about fantasy name generator, but it didn’t help me much with the kind of names I’m looking for."

I wanted to post it here because I can't celebrate it with anyone else. 

For a bit of context, I always like writing but never actually gone to the end. I wrote short stories when I was 14 but I don't like them. (It is so bad haha) One of my dream as a child was to become a writer. Knowing the scarcity of successful writers I gave up and try something else. I am now in university and only one semester left but this year I found back the motivation to write again. I always wrote some book but never finished them or when they were finished, never edited them. I don't know why but I decided to start doing one and this time finish it. 

It's still from over but this sub really gave me the motivation to go to the end. Now that I decided on it, I cannot not publish it. I would like to publish it by the end of the summer, August 30, not sure if it is possible. 

I know that I need to wait one month before touching it back, which is why I wanted to start working on the characters sheet to help during the editing and to be sure everything is coherent. I did not do it before I prefer to build the story first so I know which character I have and why do I need them to be. I can't write an outline before writing a draft. I suppose it still counts as working on the story though ha ha. 

I just wanted to share my joy in having finished the first, and the huge, part of writing and wanted to thank this community for its help and motivation. So much great content with things I never thought of before. It will seem stupid but I never knew that all first drafts were thrash and that you should never show them. The more I think about it the more it makes sense. The next months will be editing and beta reading. I probably should leave it alone for a while but I want to continue working on it. Probably bad for me. I really want to publish it before school starts so that I can see if I like it and how good/bad it's working.

I hope to be able to join all the wonderful writers out there who finally publish a book. Keep my place hot because I'm not stopping before the finish line.

This agent responded and requested that I send her the first 3 chapters of the manuscript. I figured, ""Okay, I mean, that's just an extra 20-30 pages but whatevs.""

Anyway, she responded back today with a rejection, stating that she didn't like the protagonist's ""muted reactions"" to specific incidents that occurred within the first 3 chapters.

I have a really bad tendency to get sidetracked on little details when I’m writing, mostly because I love worldbuilding haha. It’s so fun but it can get distracting and keep me from working on the story I want to tell. When I get stuck on this, I have a method of simplifying the story as much as possible by rewriting the basic plot into a children’s book. It may not work 100% with all stories, but it’s surprisingly helpful (at least for me) when I need to ignore the little details for a while and just get the basic plot written out. 

Kids’ books are usually only around 30 or so pages and have very limited dialogue, so the idea forces me to make things simple and get from beginning to end as quick as possible without removing too much from the actual story. It kind of helps me to see which details I actually do need to keep and which ones can be shortened or removed in slow parts of the real story.

I rarely finish the shortened versions of the stories but it’s surprisingly fun. I know it’s a bit of an odd technique but I’ve always found it helpful!"

I have watched many many movie analysis videos on YouTube and one of the key lessons I have learned is that a movie is especially good if it has some sort of theme that resonates in the plot and the characters and so on. A theme like love, death, family, etc.

So I started to wonder how important themes are in writing a novel, because novels are different from movies and have more space to wander around and explore many more things than just one theme.

I’m writing a screenplay for a tv show. We finished the first season which has a male lead being the main character and female lead being somewhat second leading character and now I need to write the 2nd season and we plan to kill the female lead.

Context: Male lead is a bad guy, somewhat like a antihero but worse than that. Female lead is an innocent everyday woman but she needs to die because she is the only thing matters to the male lead and he deserves it. We are going for heavy emotional roller coaster story rather than heartwarming, chill and light story.

We planned this out because killing her right off the bat in the first season finale will have less impact as she would be forgettable, so we build her character and introduce her importance in the male lead’s life.

The problem is that many of the audiences wouldn’t like that and will likely hate on the show for killing the one of the main characters. On the other hand many successful stories killed of likable, leading characters many times and the audiences just love them more because the lack of plot armor and unpredictable realistic feels.

How did they get away with it? What’s the difference between the shows that received “I was shocked that it happened, my mind was blown” vs “Shouldn’t have killed him off, the show was never the same without him, dropping this” critics? How do I kill and not ruining my entire fan base of the show?"

Sanderson also boiled Joyce's writing down to being a reference search puzzle. Essentially, he's calling it the modern version of the JoJo reference meme.

I call it story because I don’t know what else to call it. Anyway. 

This is about a kid who, after a very violent attack sought revenge. That revenge snowballed and turned into something no one could have imagined, it lead him to becoming a serial killer. He kills numerous people over many decades. It becomes a spooky story or legend that people tell at the campfire. The police have no record of this person ever being in trouble with the law, in fact all they have is a report years ago that his parents filed when he was “attacked”. The police never had any real evidence or witnesses to corroborate his story. Justice was never served. His report was tossed to the back, to never be found again. 

I have a few pages written up if this story, how it starts, I have some of what I call middle pieces, or events that happen throughout his time as a serial killer. My problem is that I don’t know how to sort everything out in my brain and put it down in story form. I guess I need to make a timeline for him. It’s just transferring it from my brain to paper that’s my problem. It feels like it’s so much yet also not enough. 

I know when I start writing it starts flowing and I go with the flow and what I’m feeling as I write. My brain is constantly going using its imagination for this. 

I don’t know I guess I just wish I could transfer it to paper easier.

No looking back. No rereading. I wanted to ensure that I will finish writing down that story first instead of spending too much time on the details early on. Since I'm new to writing, I still have a lot to learn. I realized that especially when struggling in between. I'm not native and am thus lacking more varied vocabulary and expressions, which makes it fairly harder for me to put my thoughts into words. I occasionally read books in between and I've been so amazed by the authors' writing styles. The way of describing the surroundings, feelings and actions...it's such an amazing experience to read that. When I am getting back to writing after that, I always feel somewhat down. I also want to implement emotions like that. At this point, I often question the decision I made regarding the first draft as I would never want my work to stay like that. It feels like I'm writing a movie or roleplay script, not a novel. I don't want to give up now, though. Being patient might be worth it. 

The moment I will have reached the editing part, do you think I should try writing the scenes in my native language? Like that, I might be able to find more suitable and varied expressions, which I could then implement into the original version. On the other hand, though, this might be incredibly time-consuming - without the guarantee of it changing anything to the better. Has anyone had any experiences with that?

Title - Lycus : the prophecy of annihilation
Genre : dark fantasy/paranormal/werewolves


Blurb

A blessing turned curse.
A foretold doom.
A genocide commenced.
Ages ago, mystics prophesized a great calamity to befall on the land of Vascya. When it surfaced, the Council outlawed the mate bond, the goddess’ greatest gift. To enforce their barbaric laws the Council deploys Belaize, the deadliest assassin with no moral code or compass, the greatest weapon in this war of survival and extermination.

The insurgence rises vying for peace, the rebels stand against the Council’s cruelty. Eliana, a clever warrior with heart of gold, is the next in line to be the leader of the rebellion.

While the sinister forces loom in the shadows waiting for chaos, Belaize and Eliana are at a crossroads. Tormented by their beliefs, they have the power to change the tide of the war.
Will they accept the curse, or reject the bond?
Will the rebels prevail or will Vascya fall?

A tale of love, betrayal, &amp; war.

2385,OldMarely,Discussion,17,writing,1623947097,"Have I wasted my childhood? And are there any greats who read chiefly to improve their writing? &amp;#x200B;

""An old great writer was once a young great reader"", or something to that effect (you can probably estimate by my butchering of that quote at what literary level I'm on) are the words of Terry Pratchett on the nurturing of the writer. By the account of writers (from the Dickenses to the Edmundsons) this is true. It sounds as if the writer is born out a leather-bound womb, reading any inked tree-corpse unfortunate enough to find itself in the blast-radious, by further sparkings of this post's question! Why, the bookshelves quiver to their footfalls (arriving by some interval seemingly sibling to the sun's!) , the fair-spined volumes sigh farewell to their dusted dwelling since Darwinian times, and when a knock sounds on the shopper's door, her reading-chair's curses of the toil it is ever subject to ""Weren't these people what medical restraints were built for?"". 

And not only seemed the greats unbelievably veracious, they were so, unbelievably young. Pratchett's book-purge (for example) began at 9, some start younger, some a little older...and they all wind up writers: Young devourers of books become life-long writers, it appears. And, with all that ado a-done, we come to the concern of the title: Is it always this way? Now, I know, ALWAYS is a rather encompassing word, but, my, does it sound better than ""usually"" or ""typically"" and dare not use it too near ""habitually"". 

What I truly ask is: are there any examples of great writers WRITING before reading? Reading seems to stem their imagination, interest in the craft, conceiving a love for writing that no ""great writer"" would've gone anywhere without. (As if this early reading gave a spirit behind every book, something pushing it beyond the realm of ""good""). Thus, I feel soulless in my reading compared to what they describe. I didn't hunt the great wale in Moby Dick, I admired the chase in a front seat (of a show that played at very irregular intervals) in a way seemingly unfit for any ambitious in this writing- endeavor. I know I am no Dickens or Tolkien or Proust or Pratchett, but damn it, I want to try...and I'm afraid that this lack of reading-soul will kill my dreams by hunger, thirst all that other stuff which kills you are you not properly stuffed with them. And I've not been READING until a year ago.(..let's say many years have passed since I was 9...)and now when I'm starting (doing alright so far) , it is mainly to strengthen my writing, which I've pursued some months longer. 

Is my book-less childhood an omen to being a soulless (without true passion) writer? Is one's brain like clay, in those days? Something that mold so easily, and lasts in the stresses of time? Is my brain, then, but a rather dented blob? Is it too late to shape it? Is there ANY great writer who wrote first, read later? 

I know these are stupid questions packeted in the illogical, unfounded, poorly researched ramblings of a man in distress...but questions I would love your opinions to (and comforting facts, I could marry!). 

(Please refrain from pointing to this Ps in your answers)Ps: If anyone is caused some worry by this (as it has me), don't be afraid. We all work differently, and despite what I've just asked and written: everything depends. Some write from experience, and need books less, some write from the imaginations those early tales sparked, some write without reading at all (those last ones have a strange dislike of bookshelves...I never see their names anywhere near one!). If these dreams of yours are true, a mere contingent isn't nearly obstacle enough to stop them! And, hey, I'm just an unpublished rando on the internet, don't believe anything I say! Now, excuse me whilst I cherish the answers of unpublished rando's on the internet as if their words were of gold...

The story I have in mind is about a group of 'foreign' spies who works voluntarily for the CIA, but the twist is that their identity is just a lie. They were from a program that trained foreign children to be ruthless killing machines since childhood and brainwashed into believing that they are foreign volunteers to work for the CIA. The group is angry to learn the truth, they went rogue and created an organization that is free from any jurisdiction or law. That is when the protagonist has to stop these rogue spies, which the protagonist also comes from the same program as the rogue spies.

Does it sound familiar? Yes, the Metal Gear Solid series. Rogue organization free from any jurisdiction in possession of a dangerous weapon, check. CIA secret program to have an elite spy, check. Hell, I even give the name for the leader of the rogue spies, The Boss!

The series revolves around a wizard, and a normal human, early on in the series there will be a body swap episode where the wizard uses a spell to swap their bodies, this is very cliche but that’s the point. 

At the end of the series the normal human will use the spell to switch bodies with the ancient evil main villain who is completely overpowered with no weaknesses whatsoever.

The spell is easy to learn but trivially easy to counter, this is why it’s not used all the time to stop powerful opponents, however it was invented (relatively) recently in the 1800’s, so the main villain has no knowledge of it. 

One of my main concerns is that the audience will completely forget about the spell and will think I’m just pulling it out of my ass, I do want the audience to forget about it to an extent since then they would be more surprised.

But that didn’t exist for long because our universe has certain necessities. Things that must exist. They are Fate, Death, Abstraction, Want, and Ruination. Allow me to explain.

Fate must exist for when the others came to be, so did Fate. Something cannot exist without fate and thus, it exists. Something can do nothing, and that is it’s fate. 

Death must exist because when it’s siblings were born, began to live. And there must be something to describe the opposite of life. Even if all things were immortal, death would still exist, but no one would experience it.

Abstraction exists because things exist. They are real. And what isn’t real is an abstraction. Even if everything possible exists and there is nothing more to be created, there would be thoughts. Things that cannot possibly exist. Completely abstract dreams. 

Want exists because so long as there are things with thought, they will want. Even if they wish for nothing, they want for nothing. 

Ruination exists because so long as there are beings who can exist in harmony, there will always be strife. If things can be constructed then they can also be torn down. Even if everything is indestructible then Ruination still exists, it’s just nothing can experience it. 

These beings are less gods, and more so concepts. If God wanted to erase Fate, then fate would still exist. If an omnipotent being erased Abstraction, then maybe all abstract things would vanish. But there would still be things that don’t exist."

2413,Zestyclose-Willow475,Advice,10,writing,1625537701,"Advice on Handling Multi-POV: When to Introduce? When to Shift? How Often is Too Often? Pretty much the title. The book that I'm writing is going to have 6 main characters in the group, but they're not all introduced at once (to be clear I'm planning for this to be a series, so plenty of time for all the characters to get their time later). It's a touch hard to divide the book into acts since it's a bit more of a character driven story, but I'll try to give you an idea of the pacing I have planned out. 

1st, 2nd and 3rd characters are introduced early on (within 6 chapters) and it's pretty much just them until the 'second act', with #4 being introduced right before it kicks in. #5 is introduced not long after and the group starts splitting up a lot from this point forward. #6 is brought in a few chapters before the climax starts.

So, I've been ready to approach this book with mostly a 3rd person limited perspective, but because of the amount of group splitting once the second act starts, the story isn't going to make sense if I don't POV change. So, I can't just NOT do it, I find changing POV to be way more entertaining than having the POV character have interesting stuff explained to them AFTER the fact. And yeah, character #1 is going to be going through some character development during act 2, but most of the plot relevant stuff is happening with #2 &amp; 6 at this point in time. 

BUT, I'm not sure when I should start with the POV shifting. It would be weird and jarring for me to suddenly start shifting POV in the second act, right? Or is it not so bad since it's still going to be 3rd person? Should I try POV shifting earlier in the book to make it less jarring? But then I have to pick a character to see from with each scene, and I'm not sure how to choose which one for which scenes.

The ones who are there for plot points and minimum character development. Yeah, they develop but not to the extent of the main three who take up most of the book. 

I was surprised because I wrote a plot outline with 5 points on it.

I forgot that he was the most emotional character out of all of them. I wrote 30 scenes and even hit 3 out of 5 that I wrote down. 

Honestly, his parts made me want to cry and also think that humans can be horrific. I was also worried about how dark this was since I was inspired after the author of Berserk died. I'm wondered if I accidentally made him the 4th most important character or at least top 3. 

I'm wondering if it's normal for stories with multiple characters to constantly shift who is most important and who is the favorite. He wasn't my favorite character but I think he is now. He's the one that most resembles me. Does that come with the territory since there isn't one focal point?"

I could do it in third person entirely, which may make sense still and might help me balance things out completely. But to sum it up, I was thinking that the stories would revolve around one character being told from first person while the other is completely third person. 

There are in-story reasons for me coming to that choice with it being that the first person portion of the story is being told by the character themselves to another character whereas the third person part is more so to further flesh out a character just as important. Their sections would be focused on through chapter titles, being ‘Remembrance’ for the first person man and ‘Guilt’ for the third person character.

I assume that my chances of getting it accepted increase the more polished the manuscript is before I send it out. However, I also would guess that the more work I do ahead of getting an editor, the less helpful a potential editor would be and the more I will have wasted my time doing things the editor will just recommend cutting or redoing anyway.

Is it okay to have one character be in 1st person in her chapters, and the other character's chapters in 3rd person limited? 

I generally prefer 1st person, but I don't want to do them both that way. I started out 3rd person for both of them, but the 1st-person character is much funnier and her inner dialogue is entertaining, and I hate doing a bunch of thoughts in italics all the time. She is also the one that leaves home for the first time and travels through the world experiencing tons of new things, and a romantic subplot. She has more action and fight scenes.

The 3rd person storyline is much more about intrigue and uncovering secrets, royal court politics, that kind of thing.

However, they are both slightly unreliable POVs, and the person who is in 3rd person view is actually even MORE unreliable even though technically she is not the narrator. 

3rd person is always more challenging when I want to delve into the character's thoughts more. Anyway, is it okay to have both in one story?"

2429,harper_k_graham,Advice,5,writing,1625528426,"The A-10 ""Warthog"" and making writing decisions. It's hard to make decisions about what and how to write. What needs describing? Should your MC wear pants, or shorts? There are a million 'this or that' decisions that must be made to write a story. How to resolve them?

I believe other fields of design have something to offer the struggling writer. Consider the A-10. It's a funny-looking plane. Look at the engines. Why are they up so high and outside the body of the plane? How did the designer decide to put them there? You could ask that of every little bit of it. Why are the wings so long and flat? Etc.

The key is two-fold: 

1) There was a single highest-priority performance goal.

The goal for the A-10 was this: blow up tanks. That's it. Every single decision made in the design process was informed by that one single goal. So for writing: **select a highest-priority goal.** You can't even begin to decide among your infinite options of words and structures unless you know why you are writing and, ideally, have some means of testing that success. Do you want to inform on a specific topic? Do you want to entertain, to frighten, to unsettle? Decide on a goal and it will allow you to decide whether the MC where pants or shorts so you don't have to ask strangers on the internet every time you hit a crossroad. Or, if you truly have no goal, understand that this makes every decision arbitrary so just flip a coin. *So many writers have no idea why they are writing and seem oblivious to how this destroys their ability to make decisions as they write.* 

2) There was a starting point.

Engineers design things around a starting point. The A-10 looks funny because that starting point was unusual. Most planes and cars and ships and other things that move on their own power are designed around the powerplant, the engine. The starting point for the A-10 was the *gun,* which served the purpose of busting open lots of tanks since they are rather thin on top*.* This gun has physical aspects such as size and weight that drive every other design element. The size of the plane, the shape, the structure, the size of the engines and the placement of the landing gear and every other element was subordinated to that starting gun that needed to work above all else. 

Once you have a goal for writing, **pick a starting point.** It could be a character or a place or a time period or anything, but there should be that *first* element that is the nucleus of the entire work. Where to start? Refer to 1). When you have 1) you have a destination and when you have 2) you have a specific place to begin. If you keep your destination in mind you can navigate the path from here to there with regards to writing. Every decision along the entire process has 1) as a tie-breaker and 2) as a concrete supporting element. 

I picked the A-10 for a reason, too. It is *weird.* It's so damn ugly they nicknamed it the 'Warthog'. It's also extremely effective at doing what it was designed to do. The weirdness makes every bit of sense once you know what it was trying to do. **A lot of writers are very worried about being weird.** How many questions on this board are some variation of ""Is it OK/right/acceptable/normal to write \[X\]?"" These questions aren't really about writing at all. It's more like someone asking ""Is it OK to blow up tanks from the air?"", the answer to which lies far outside the art and craft of engineering. Once you've resolved to pop tanks from on high you can set about picking the best tools to do so and designing the right sort of machine to convey those tools, but the goodness of the *goal* is not something an engineer can help you with. No more can a bunch of writers tell you if your writing goal is good or bad. You must resolve that by your lonesome.

Is it OK to write what you want to write? Consider the goal. Imagine you've succeeded and *everyone knows it.* Can you live with that? If not, remain silent. If yes, go forth and sin boldly along your quest. Pick a goal, select your starting point, and start writing. Or don't."

I’m a brand new baby writer and I just started sending out my first finished short story.

I know that I should expect many (many!) rejections and one is nothing, so I’m not giving up hope. In fact, I’ve already moved on to the next magazine so I can make sure that I don’t give up and keep myself on the roller coaster ride. It did, however, raise the question of how many rejections should I go through before I accept that maybe this story is not publishable and start working on the next one?

So, the following situation happens with me: I wanna write a story, but before starting it, I find some nice book and start reading it. And the book is amazing, the characters, the dialogue, the plot, the twists, the worldbuilding, and I get so immersed in it that I think ""Man, I wanna write something as good as this"" or, more simply, ""I just wanna write something"". 

You basically get pumped up by the book you are reading, and you wanna write something, right? Does that happen with you guys? I feel it is pretty normal.... but well, that's where it gets curious, or should I say, kind of paradoxical, because you get motivated to write something by reading a good book, but you can't stop reading the book to write, right? I mean, yeah, you can do both, but when your time is limited, it is kind of hard. And for me at least, even if I write only as a hobby, I can't just start writing something out of nowhere, I need some kind of ""preparation"".

And another thing I find it curious: When I get motivated to write something because I'm reading a awesome book, I subconsciously take these ideas, situations and characters from the novel I'm reading and throw them in the story I'm writing. It just happens.

I remember when I was reading a mystery/thriller book, and meanwhile I was doing some brain storm about a school setting story, with some romance and drama, and guess what, I just had this idea of putting a murder that happened on the school grounds, and I constructed a ""solve this mystery"" as the main plot of the story, with bits of romance and drama that I initially thought about. It turned out pretty good, but I was kind of afraid that I was so influenced by what I was reading at that time. Does that happen you guys too?"

The message spoke about brain implants and how, by protocol, it was required to go through the procedure to get one, for long journeys like this one. Vanessa was to be in charge of finding out, which of the people coming on the trip has had the procedure, and to arrange for them to get the procedure.   
This was convenient for the CIC, she knew. Because she did not have an implant it was easy to add this to her list of punishments.

2465,Karbantms,Advice,1,writing,1625513599,"How to write a classic/mythic fantasy. **Background**

I have wanted to write fantasy since I was little. A few years ago, I even thought I would actually write a book, but I always failed. Mainly because I couldn't decide on the story and especially the environment. I rejected every idea, saying it either sounds silly or has already been written.

The truth is, I don't want to write an original environment. Not because I couldn't create my own creatures and deities, but because I loved mythological stories from an early age. Greek, Norse, Egyptian and Slavic stories, deities and creatures is my passion and I want to write a book from this environment at all costs.

The problem is that on every tutorial, lesson ... I've read or been in, I've heard one and the same thing over and over again ... Don't create a fantasy ala Tolkien. Such manuscripts are immediately thrown into the trash by publishers.

I have an idea for a world that, although magical, makes sense. I have created answers to common questions about the classic fantasy world ... Why is technological progress stopped in antiquity / the Middle Ages. Isn't magic too much OP? Why haven't all those races killed themselves long ago. How can there be such a thing as Egyptian culture and mythology in a place where the Nile does not exist.

**Question**

How to create a classic fantasy without at first glance shouting that it is a copied tolkien.

How would you make such a story stand out?

I plan to make my story and the depiction of mythology completely different from the tolkien, but every time I describe my world, it sounds like an ordinary fantasy written by a 14-year-old nerd.

**My own answer**

I don't write High fantasy ala Tolkien.

I try to plant my story (No Saving the World from Evil.) In a world in which the mythologies of Antiquity and the Middle Ages are real. (Such an alternative Europe where mythology is real ...)

Creatures, races, gods and magic are the same as in mythology.

No flower licking archers as elves, No greedy miners and Mithril warriors as dwarves.

Magic works like:

* Alfseidr (Natural magic of elves and Vanir (older natural gods.)
* Runic magic (two types. The first is a seer, such a shaman. The second is a runic mage, very rare, who can use the runes to influence the world.)
* Illusion of jotunns.

**Minor spoiler... Well big spoiler**

The whole world works on the fact that belief in gods gives power to gods, and once you believe in a god, that god actually begins to exist, or disappears when he is forgotten.

In the old world, the gods faced oblivion as people began to believe in another new religion (which could probably be ...) so they decided to start again, moving to the new world to dwell it with the last of their followers. Did I say gods? In fact, it is one almighty entity that has no form, no name, no person and takes on the form that people believe in.

When such an Egyptian encounters Hades. Hades takes on the form of the Egyptian god of death ... Usir (Many people know him more as Osiris)

It is practically one deity with mega DID.

to make matters worse, I built the creation of the world, an explanation of the inconsistencies and a story on something I temporarily call a break event, in the creation of the world it is called a big break (maybe I will rename it)

A break event is an event in which the universe tries to handle paradoxes (caused by magic, faith or gods) and not fall apart.

Thanks to the break event, two different versions of the stories merge, for example, such Horus in Egyptian mythology, who is sometimes depicted as one of the oldest gods and the brother of Isis, Usir and Sutech. Elsewhere, he is depicted as a young god and the son of Isis and Usir. Thanks to the break event, Hor is both the son of Isis and Usir and at the same time their brother. Both stories have happened and both are real and you will see the type of Horus you believe in.

When the old gods tried to create a new world, there was such a big break event that it could no longer merge the two realities and instead created a new one. As a result, the break event erased the evidence that some gods existed at all, and what was left became only stories and myths.

I know it's different for everyone, but I was personally struggling to keep my notes organized. I have a real board with sticky notes, plus separate files for different kind of notes, but it was hard to navigate, or when you need to add a new note - I had to either find the right file first, or write it down wherever and then later spend time in sorting these things. 

So Trello is free and it's same as board with sticky notes, with some enchantments: 

On real sticky notes, you are limited on space. Here you can have long texts for each note (card). You can move cards between lists, add attachments, comments, and labels. I love that if you add an image - you can view it on board, so you can have visual references if needed.

I made several lists for my project, and, for example, when I am writing and something hits me, I open this app and add a note under appropriate list. 

Lists I personally have are:

1. To do -  stuff I plan to work on in the near future.
2. Questions - open questions I need to think about.
3. Comments - general comments about story or events. 
4. For Later -  stuff I plan to work on in later sections. 
5. Characters - I have separate lists for complicated characters, and everyone else goes under ""other characters"".
6. Rejected ideas - stuff that didn't work out but might try again later. 

So just wanted to share this with other writers. Hope it doesn't sound like an ad. There are other tools similar to this I am sure, I just happened to know Trello from work, where we use it for other purposes. 

And I was thrilled to find that it's free for personal use! (If you are a CEO of Trello reading this... please... keep it like this). 

Hope it can be helpful for somebody. If it's a common thing or if everyone has their stuff organized and it was just my personal problem being buried in notes - my apologies :D

Like many of people around the world, my mental health definitely took a toll. I have been seeking professional help (a therapist and a counselor) for quite a while now to help with my mental health and personal issues. My therapist recognized that I am a creative person and thinks I need a proper creative outlet to help with my mental health and have something to be proud of and I could not agree more. There are a few hobbies I would like to get into but I want to start with one that is attainable and not setting myself up for failure. I used to write stories for my ex-girlfriend and I would enjoy writing them as much as she would enjoy reading them so I think I want to follow this.

I have a few things I would like to bring up beforehand and would appreciate some advice and guidance from people of this community:

The first thing is I have never been a strong or fast reader. I struggle to finish reading large bodies of text. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and only been medicated for it 10 months now but it does not seem to help that much. I find I get so distracted when I read and I constantly have to reread paragraphs over and over. Will this be an issue when it comes to writing? Have I been just reading texts I find boring which is why I cannot focus? Anyone else experience this kind of issue?

The next thing is regarding style of writing. My true passion is making people laugh. Nothing brings me more joy than having people laugh or enjoy a funny story I have told them. If I am going to start writing, it is 100% going to be comedy. I am way too self-conscious to do stand-up and I live in a remote community so it is not really an option anyways. Is there any tips or advice when it comes to writing comedy? I am not opposed to taking online lessons and paying to improve my abilities if that is what it takes. Do people recommend writing comedy in script form or like how a novel is written?

Lastly, I just was wondering about any other tips people have when it comes to writing. Maybe unique ideas on how a story is planned, structured, or though-out. Writing environment advice would be appreciated too. I get very easily distracted so I feel like public settings could be difficult. Any advice regarding writing would be greatly appreciated. 

I really want to be successful at this and finally have a creative outlet. I have never been good at anything creative. I always thought I was logic brained since I had a passion for math and science in school and I was never good at anything artistic. I find now I want more than anything to create something, spend time by myself, and be proud of something. I barely even have any hobbies. Doing drugs and partying was honestly the biggest hobby I have had and I need help getting away from it. I will appreciate any help anyone can give.

You’d think, on the third paragraph, I’d be able to just keep going. The reader would be hooked. But with nothing more than a WHAT IF question to spark my writing, I can’t seem to get beyond that pesky third paragraph.

I figure the reader wants AN EVENT after that point, but I never came up with one. There’s seemingly no way for me to do it without it coming across like I just pulled it out of my ass because I did.

However, if I know the plot, I have a miserable time writing the story. But if I don’t know the plot, then I can’t determine what incident would spark it into motion.

The standard answer to this problem generally seems to be that you have to just think of something to happen to your character.

I mean…okay.

But whenever I try that, the event feels forced. It’s like the reader can tell I didn’t have it from the beginning. Also, I always just resort to an abrupt event, like some guy bursting into the room with a gun. The ultimate cliché. I can just tell the reader doesn’t buy it because I wouldn’t buy it, either.

Anyone else out there consider this issue a thing? Is the premise of a story supposed to BE the inciting incident? My WHAT IF questions are always just like “What if it was illegal to have children the old-fashioned way?” or something like that. There’s no hint of an inciting incident from the question alone, only the general scenario. So am I supposed to come up with a statement of an event after writing that question—before writing the first sentence? Or how about this, is the WHAT IF question supposed to BE the incident? Like, “What if you were gardening one day and an alien ship appeared in the sky and started attacking a nearby city?”

Sounds boring to me. Seems like it would kill the voice. My character can’t know what the inciting incident is going to be if they’re going to be genuinely surprised, right?

My personal preference is for the characters to feel real. I like the quality of the prose when they are discovery written. But damn, if this method isn’t confusing as fuck.

But I do NOT outline. I’ve been writing long enough to know outlining is my nightmare. I’m definitely looking for the discovery writer’s solution to this, but I’ve rarely heard anyone discuss the issue openly.

I’d hate to write yet another story that doesn’t work. I’m pretty sure I’ve written over a hundred short stories at this point, and I don’t think a single one has actually done the trick. The ideas work fine, the characters are likable, even the action and dialogue work. It’s just this damn voice issue that seems to screw me every single time.

I just want the voice to stay good. That’s the whole thing. But it always goes bad at this exact point—right after I finish writing this sentence, the last sentence of what was essentially the third paragraph of this post.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Okay, now I’ll keep going just to show you what I mean. I don’t know if you can tell, but the voice is gone now. It just isn’t the same. The mojo is missing. All the momentum is gone. Obviously, I’ve already said all I had to say, so this part feels superfluous by comparison. I’ll keep going just to drive the point home. Do you see what I mean, though? I’m in molasses all of a sudden. I’m having difficulty even coming up with the next sentence to write. But all those words I wrote up there were written at lightspeed by comparison. This shit right here is moving at impulse. Not to mention, everything is inherently redundant, even meaningless since I closed the loop already. I cauterized the voice somehow. I bet you want me to stop now, but I’m going to go on a little longer to make you see. I’m sure you want to kill yourself right now, reading this part, and I’m sorry. But I couldn’t think of a better way to illustrate my point. But I’ll stop now. Please help me, though. It sucks to have such a fundamental-seeming thing holding me back all these years. I just want to fix the problem. God, I have a headache from this last bit. All right. I’m done."

I am not sure how many of you are interested or struggle with this but character development can be a key part of writing fiction. I made a tool to help outline a more believable character as you are in game in development (link here:[https://mdc78890.itch.io/novel-or-video-game-character-generator](https://mdc78890.itch.io/novel-or-video-game-character-generator)). It's only $3.50 and includes the source code (It's got a lot of POSIX (basically like a Mac) focused code but those should be easy to edit). It's written in Java, so it shouldn't matter what platform you are on if you are on desktop. If it's something that helps you, great!"

Hello everyone, so I have never written a book before, but ever since I was a child I wanted to, it didn't help that my teachers thought I'd be good at it because of short stories I wrote for exams, so I gave it some thought, I have a basic idea for my story but not a name. 

In the very unlikely event that any of you ever find the book and decide to give it a read there's basically no way I'll avoid spoilers with this, so sorry 

But to avoid giving too much the main focus of the book is on the protagonist and how he/she deals with their emotions, it focuses on a protagonist who finds themself reincarnated, unfortunately for them, they're reincarnated into the same world, the same country, almost immediately after dying, the story picks up from their teenage years after they got their memories of their past life, even more unfortunate is that there's practically no way to avoid seeing the people they knew in their past life when they're still a teenager and no way to reveal their reincarnation without being locked up in an asylum or ostricized as a ""freak""

This story explores mental health, emotional stability, quite a few trigger warnings, grief, and more 

Only issue is I'm not exactly decisive when it comes to naming things, too many ideas floating in my head to even try narrowing down."

2519,Sasha_Sober, ,1,writing,1628669183,"Why do I like sadness? Why do I like sadness?


Amongst more than 84 lakh species in the universe, only humans are endowed with a plethora of emotions such as sadness, happiness, anger and many more. The expression of these emotions, in particular, keeps us humane and conventionally normal. Although all these emotions are an integral part of us, we still don't want to own some emotions, for example sadness. It is because it appears pensive, non entertaining, uninvolved and boring. 


Fearing being misfit, most often we hide this side of ourselves from everyone and try to become what others want us to be. Sometimes, I as an individual, feel like don’t we reject a part of ourselves by doing so? Because for me, sadness has never been just  one of the emotions, rather an ocean's peace that gives me a chance to internalize and assess myself amidst the waves of life. It is the ripple that doesn't create chaos but soothes and gives hope to reach the shore one day. And above all, sadness not just that makes me reticent but saves me too from being a mindless chatter-box. Because, often in excitement, humans begin to speak unrestrainedly and later regret the words spoken or promises made beyond the league.   


But obviously as people have different personalities, they perceive sadness differently and it is quite justified too because sadness is not something that happens to us rather that happens within us. 


but I strongly think that depending on the usage, the feeling of sadness has the capacity to be used as a tool or a medium that can transform many lives , both for the best and the worst. This is also because suffering is a universal feeling and often in the rat race of life, people come close to share happiness but, in case of sadness one has to go through it all alone. Therefore, suffering remains lying inside for years in people, unshared and unspoken. 


And I have realized that there is a person inside each one of us, which is untapped, unexpressed but remains fluttering to get expressed. That's why I believe that more than happiness, sharing the suffering is the fastest medium to connect  with a person. 

 

Whilst, one can go for the self talk too but it's inadequate and has often been considered or declared as cynical. So due to these taboos, people often keep these emotions locked inside and wander in search of a person who can just lend their ears and listen impartially &amp; sympathetically. 


Therefore, at the end, I’d say that the feeling of sadness  has the potential to transform a person into a strong personality if we really learn the art of perceiving it with a different tonality. Otherwise it is like we are carrying a grenade within ourselves, which can be proven fatal not only to us but also to the society. "

Started a story a few years ago, forgot it’s ending, and now I’m just confused.

I know how to create endings for stories I make. But the issue lies in the fact that I forgot my ending..

Let me explain. A few years ago, I wrote the beginning to what was going to be a short story. Unfortunately, I guess I was busy, or lacked the drive to actually, well, finish it. Fast forwards to now, and I read over the story one more time. I loved it, and it has some foreshadowing in the very beginning. Later that day, I showed my friends the draft to reminisce on my old writing, and I was surprised to see them want me to continue it. So, I showed some other friends, and they all agreed that I had made quite the captivating beginning.

And now I’m just sad over the fact that I can’t remember the ending to this great story. The way I write is that I always think of an ending, and create a world to build from it. To me, losing the ending is like losing the story.

But, can’t I just make a new ending? Well, yeah. I guess I can. But there’s something wrong with ignoring my foreshadowing done in the beginning, to create an ending that might not match my original vision.

So there's this place called the Temple of Broken Saints and when the characters arrive, it really seems more like a homeless shelter, but I make it clear that they are a temple and they worship the ""old gods"" which is a faith that has been overshadowed by a newer church in the city.

So yeah, the temple takes them in, bathes them, shelters them, feeds them, etc. But then the leader, a man named Gaspar, asks the main character to kill someone for him. It turns out he used to be a member of a morally gray fuel refining business in town who is in cahoots with the new religion, but he came to the temple after his sister (who started the temple) was assassinated by some unknown entity when she protested against the new religion.

But I digress. So anyway one of the characters is a girl who has an intimate night with the MC where they sit on the roof and talk about trauma from their past. It turns out both of them are averse to sexual desire because of their trauma, but they still desire closeness - and so they sleep together (platonically).

But then the next day, the MC ,through mysterious circumstances, finds the girl in the room in which they spent the night together and she's being beaten with padded rods.

The MC beats up the two people doing it and they flee in terror. The priest character then walks in and explains that he doesn't like the ""ceremony"" any more than the MC does, but it is the ""way of the old gods"" and as much as he would like to change it, he can't. It is their dogma.

The girl character is what they call *Sulia* which means she has been tainted by excessive fornication in her previous life, and is not allowed to have ""intimate physical contact"" with others, even if it's just cuddling. She was forced into sex slavery but despite this,  she's still deemed *Sulia.* 

The MC is obviously angry about this and he demands to know who tattled on them. It turns out that the girl turned herself in.

I guess I'm trying to make a statement about certain popular religions in the world and how they treat women who are deemed ""impure"", and how some women in these religions have been so indoctrinated that they would do such a thing as turn themselves in for punishment like this.

My editor hates this and he says either the punishment should be less severe, or she and the main character should actually have sex. He also said something about how it's not ""relatable"" for a western audience (but I personally don't care about this point as much).

I like it like this and I don’t want to change it. It works out a lot better this way. However, I want to give the side characters more development and I cannot change the number of the team either.

2532,marchecto, ,1,writing,1628660660,"Tips to Get Success in Student Life **Below here are necessary steps for students to achieve success in student life.**

1. Keep studies as your first priority

A good student never ignores his studies and Keep their studies on the topmost priority list. Managing time for friends, relatives, and family is also important but not by ignoring your studies because what you have learned will remain lifelong with you. You should never neglect the time which is meant for your studies.

2. Set SMART Goals

In students’ life, the very first benefit of setting a goal is to achieve success in their academic life. It marks their first step towards success. Setting a smart goal is important for your future bright. S.M.A.R.T goal stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. This helps them to achieve what they want to be in life and work according to their goals.

3. Time Management

Be punctual always. Time Management is a must in a students’ life. The purpose of time management is to enable them to do more and better work in less time. Always remember successful students or the students who want to be successful in life manage their time so that they can easily have time to study as well as to play.

4. Take part in Classroom &amp; School Activities

Participating in various activities conducted in the school makes you an active member. You should actively take part in classroom activities as well by answering the questions of your teachers and clearing your doubts. Being attentive in the class helps students to understand better.

Stay active in daily classroom activities &amp; become a part of all the activities being organized in school as well as in the classroom, if possible. This will help you develop a good relationship with your teachers &amp; other fellow students.

5. Pay attention to What Teachers teach

Always pay attention to what the teachers say in the classroom.  This not only shows respect towards them but also it is useful for the students to understand and grasp the subject easily. It also helps them to improve listening skills.

Paying attention in class is absolutely necessary to become successful in life as a student. Keep your eyes &amp; ears open to what the teacher is teaching.

While it’s obvious that you don’t need to love every single subject, but its’ also important to avoid all distractions nearby you &amp; stay active when your teacher is teaching in the classroom. It is better listening to him/her carefully in the class rather than chatting with your friends or to remain confused throughout the day.

6. Study in a Group

Studying in groups help the students to learn more effectively. Educational psychologists have shown in their research that students working or learning together in a group of friend circle do much better as compared to those who study alone.

Have you ever heard the phrase, “two heads are better than a single one”?

Well, this becomes true when it comes to studying. Working in groups enables you to benefits like whenever you are struggling to understand a concept; you can take help from other group members, help them in their needs &amp; also can complete the given work more quickly.

Sitting down with a group of friends who are doing or learning the same thing as you are, is one of the best ways to gain knowledge.

7. Stay Committed to Studies

Never quit, stay committed to your studies. Don’t get panic even when you don’t perform well. Always work hard &amp; hard until you get success. If you are not good at something, don’t just ignore it and try to focus on it.

Always stay committed toward your studies &amp; try to stay focused while you study. Successful students always focus on the tasks at hand.

For example, if you’ve planned to study a chapter of your history book, just stay committed commit to your words rather than letting your mind wander here &amp; there in ideal things. After that, take a short break from studies, if needed. But don’t make this short break a bigger one.

Don’t let it run over an hour long break with 10-15minutes of study.

8. Avoid Distractions

Disturbances from one or the other way will always be there in your way.  When you concentrate on something deeply you are able to learn the things more effectively. Try to get rid of meaningless distractions that come in between your studies. Always keep your goal in mind and work accordingly as it saves your precious time.

9. Don’t compare with others

Never do the comparison with others because everyone has their own abilities and capabilities. Good students succeed on their own capability. Don’t copy what others do, follow your own way.

Comparison lets you downtrodden &amp; you’ll feel discouraged. Don’t bother what your friends, neighbors or partners are doing. Because at last, all that matters is your own success.

10. Learn from your Mistakes

It is good that you learn from your mistakes because the most important lessons in life can be learned by improving from our mistakes. A *successful student* learns from his own mistakes and tries to improve further.

You can’t learn from your mistake until you admit that you have done it. Never ever underestimate yourself! Instead, learn from mistakes as this is the best thing when you yourself get to know what wrong you have done &amp; how to resolve this.

Also, stop committing the same mistake again &amp; again. Putting what you’ve learned into practice is yet another advantage for students if they want to be successful in their life.

These are some of the traits of successful students as the most successful students know that only learning &amp; reading is not just being in school, it is a life-long process.

2533,twocantherapper,Advice,1,writing,1628660641,"These ""Writing Rules/Guidelines"" y'all keep asking for feedback on are a trap. I've seen loads of these ""what are the rules for writing X/Y/Z"" posts. I've also seen people put up lists of them and ask questions like ""Before I start writing my book what rules are missing?""

Best advice I can give you: STOP WITH THE LIST AND WRITE!

Reading is also hella helpful, obvs, but actually writing is the only way you can learn to tell better stories/more compelling poetry/a stage worthy script etc.

Watch interviews with famous authors. Literally none of them talk about how important their lists of guidelines were. The only time rules and guidelines matter is with spelling, grammar, and editing.

Because here's a secret, guys. Until you find your feet as a writer you'll have no idea what you do/do not struggle with. I am a natural when it comes to good story pacing and spinning an intriguing yarn. Way back when though, I sucked at describing faces and expressions.

I don't now, and the reason? As a writing excercise I'd spend 5 minutes a day writing descriptions of people's faces. I'd pay extra close attention in books when faces were described. Also, I looked up word banks of ""face words"" to widen my vocabulary. 

It had nothing to do with lists and guidelines and everything to do with practice. You need to learn how to write confidently before thinking about writing ""well"". 

Train yourself to smash out 500 words a day minimum. Watch lectures online with your full attention (not with your attention on the cool list of writer notes you'll have at the end). Write a load of trash you're never going to publish. Do little 5 minute timed excercise before writing your book. Read more. All of these are way more useful for becoming a decent writer than any of these lists."

2. **Don't multitask.** Studies have shown that multitasking is physically impossible. 
3. **Divide it up.** Studying isn't fun to begin with, and forcing yourself through a study marathon will only make it worse. Dividing your work into manageable chunks and rewarding yourself when you finish each chunk will make studying (more) fun.
4. **Sleep.** Don't underestimate the importance of those eight hours of zzz's every night! Getting a good night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory.
5. **Set a schedule.** Do you work better right after school or after you've eaten dinner? Are you more productive in 90-minute blocks or half-hour spurts? Find a schedule that works for you, and stick to it. 
6. **Take notes.** Taking notes will not only keep you more engaged during class, but will also help you narrow down what you need to study when exam time rolls around. It's much easier to reread your notes than to reread your entire textbook!
7. **Study.** This one might be obvious, but did you know that there's a right and a wrong way to study? Review your material several days ahead of time, in small chunks, and in different manners (for example, write flashcards one day and take practice tests the next). In other words, don't cram. 
8. **Manage your study space.** Find a place that will maximize your productivity. Look for places away from the television and other distractions. Whether it's your local library or just the desk in your bedroom, set aside a study space that you'll want to spend time in. 
9. **Find a study group.** Sitting down with a group of people who are learning the same things as you is a great way to go over confusing class material or prepare for a big test. You can quiz each other, reteach material, and make sure that everyone is on the same page. After all, teaching someone else is the best way to learn. 
10. **Ask questions.** You're in school to learn, so don't be afraid to do just that! Asking for help - from a teacher, a tutor or your friends - is a surefire way to make sure you truly understand the material.

I’m unsure if this is my ADHD just being inpatient whilst reading, is this something you identify with? Much love 📚"
2537,Primohippo,Discussion,66,writing,1628657648,"For a while I’ve been taking notes on story structure, character, and other things, is there anything that I am missing or that I got wrong? Just to preface this, because I have get the feeling someone is going to point this out in the comments: I know that these aren’t necessarily set in stone rules, and that just knowing these things isn’t enough to write a story by itself.

Also some of these tend to repeat themselves, so sorry about that.

Also also, this is kind of long so you don’t necessarily need to read the whole thing if you don’t want to.

Notes:

	◦	Story should ask a question. (Hypothetical, usually unanswered, tied to theme)
	◦	Look at dan harmons story circle, it can be useful.  ?
	◦	Characters should embody themes.
	◦	Start with hook
	◦	Foreshadowing/setup of events (typically paid off later in story)
	◦	Set groundwork for character arcs in beginning (eg character flaws)
	◦	Rising action starts after intro. ?
	◦	Conflict begins after intro (midsection).  ?
	◦	Info from intro is expanded upon (Midsection)
	◦	Character changes/grows based on flaws (trait A &gt; Event B &gt; Trait C) or (maintaining a trait through adversity)
	◦	A character can have many arcs if they end quick?
	◦	If something is supposed to be a threat, you need to see WHY you should be afraid of it
	◦	Plot contrivance is when the plot is pushed forward by luck and not cause and effect: don’t do this
	◦	Stakes are built on cause and effect
	◦	If a story is building up a reveal, the events of the story should still be meaningful even without that reveal
	◦	Morality should (?) have some complexity, rather than absolute good and evil. 
	◦	The winner of a conflict or argument isn’t necessarily 100% right, nor their opposition 100% wrong
	◦	“Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose.” Not really a rule but can add some interesting stuff.
	◦	Must explain why something is the right (or wrong) choice, not just say that it is.
	◦	If a character gives exposition, it should 
	•	a) make sense for them to do this 
	•	b) tell us more about that character (and others around them) than what they are explicitly saying (e.g. their feelings on what they are explaining, or how others react to what they say. Still has to be subtle though, don’t iust have them explain their feelings, instead show their feelings through the way they talk about the thing)
	◦	Have more than one story moving in parallel. “Meanwhile, back at the ranch”: “When you reach the peak of one you go to the other. When it loses interest, you pick the other up just where you want it, when it loses interest, drop it. Meanwhile back at the ranch.” (Often done using chapters). This keeps the momentum going.
	◦	For tv, the narrative climax usually hits around the 2 thirds mark “like clockwork”. In screenwriting this is called the ‘break into 3’
	◦	Occasionally ‘resting’ from the main plot allows audience to ‘breathe’, and lets them catch up with characters’ state of mind. It also builds tension, as the moments that are ‘in’ the main plot to land harder (not sure if this is just for comedy or for all stories)
	◦	Extreme/ over the top stuff is better when tethered to something grounded and emotional.
	◦	The ending should be the culmination of all that has come before it. (I think?)


Character:

	◦	Villain attack hero’s weakness
	◦	Villain relatable
	◦	Villain is best person to use hero’s weakness
	◦	villain has backstory
	◦	keep villan and hero close together/ in same room
	◦	villain has layers
	◦	villain opposite view of hero
	◦	villain human(emotionally)
	◦	villain/hero similar
	◦	Opposing values
	◦	Balance between creativity and structure
	◦	More backstory =/= better character (at least not necessarily)
	◦	Main (?) character’s first scene should show all/most of what you need to know about them
	◦	Main character should fail before they succeed. The harder success is, the stronger they seem
	◦	Strong character means they fail and keep going, not that they don’t fail
	◦	Strong relationship b/n hero and villain can help story
	◦	Every action the character takes should be explainable based on who they are/ what their traits are
	◦	Furthermore, every action a character takes tells the audience about what that character is like.
	◦	Don’t have characters state their motivation
	◦	Every action a character takes should be either consistent with or expand upon their current characterisation
	◦	Not enough to understand that a character feels something, we must understand why they feel it.
	◦	Character motivations and traits should be a part of the story, not tacked on to the story
	◦	Characters need multiple (strong) character traits (that meld well together)
	◦	Characters should have thoughts/feelings about and react appropriately to everything they experience based on their characterisation
	◦	Have conflicts or bonding based on similarities or differences in character traits
	◦	Character should have moral principles. Acting according to them characterises them, or being forced/pushed to break them may show growth or further characterisation. (Maybe acting against them could also characterise them but I’m not sure)
	◦	Characters feelings should always affect them, not just when/if they discuss them
	◦	We must understand WHY characters have the relationships that they do (not through them explaining it)
	◦	Character development should happen gradually
	◦	Characters can act immorally, if the story acknowledges that it is immoral, or at least questionable
	◦	There are a lot of ways to express a character’s perspective (not just through them saying it)
	◦	If a conversation is had, you be able to understand why each character is saying each line they have

2538,Dangerous-Ant-4700,Advice,5,writing,1628657526,"Humor (and why I'm weird with it) Fellow humans of Reddit. I have come seeking advice from you lads. It's in the title but I should elaborate. I'm creating a YA Epic Fantasy novel. My friends have noticed this, but recently I realized I have a very juvenile sense of humor. This is mainly because the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series were (and still are) my favorite books. My brain has always been like this and now that I'm older it hasn't changed. When I made my novel I was looking back at the first draft and I saw how childish the jokes seemed. Of course the main characters are fourteen year old's but since this is a YA novel I thought it might pull you out of the story.  

Here's an excerpt of one of the moments in the story. Context is that these are all gods discussing what the best era was. 

""Ah I look fondly back on those days. The Element Age was the best,"" Ash said. 

Wave scoffed. ""Lies. It really took them that long to discover magic existed. The Weapons age was better. I've never seen such mastery in swordsmanship since then,"" the water god replied. 

Tree, the calmer one of the group shook his head. ""Both of you are wrong. The Classical Age is the best. Such wonders the world was introduced to when it happened."" 

The lightning god Radian and the ice goddess Frost leaned from their thrones to look at them. 

""None of you are aloud to talk. Ash you only liked that age because the population was mainly female,"" Radian said, ""Tree you should shut your mouth as well. Nothing good came when they made that instrument of  yours."" 

""What's wrong with that?"" Ash said, they ignored Tree's angry glares. 

""Don't play dumb Ash. We watched you go into their houses, and they had husbands as well. My god I don't understand how none of them got pregnant.""

""Who the hell said you had to watch? You are the worst one out of all of us. You liked the Element Age because it had the most wars.""

""So. What's wrong with liking heads getting ripped off?"" They all stared at him. 

""Everything, everything is wrong,"" Frost said. 

That wasn't my best work, but you get the point. Is it weird because this type of humor goes on for the entire book. Should I change it to middle grade fantasy or just change the style of humor. I don't really want to just add a string of curses to make it sound more ""adult"" because that wouldn't fix the problem. So Lords and Ladies', could you perhaps lend me a hand with this predicament."

It was easy to untangle certain matters when you were simply an observer. 

On an unusually quiet afternoon, as silent as night amidst what should have been a boisterous day, sat Maude Turner on the curb.The hours prolonged, the seconds amplified by the bone shattering cold air of winter that was indeed far more excruciating than yesterday, or the day before yesterday

infact, it was different than any other day. 

Maude spent majority of her days sitting on the curb beside her neighbours’ collection of herbs, fiddling with the leaves and watching the passersby in amusement. She did not feel the need to partake in the strenuous actions of the day to day life her townspeople ought to find customary. Whether it be a situation regarding her personal life or a social event. In her mind, she recalled life to be a poorly produced film, and her, the only audience member. It was not mandatory for a sense of purpose to be bestowed upon her. 

Maude did not enjoy beginnings, or causing for something to come to an end. Her entire life, she has only known what resides between birth and death. It was a custom belief of hers that all things fall into where they should eventually, and shackling the chains of fate would only cause more damage than good. She took this belief quite literally and spent all afternoon doing nothing."

The argument is that it's important to not spend TOO MUCH time on a single passion project to the exclusion of any other creations, because it courts burnout and also makes you too sensitive to criticism of your precious baby WIP.

They argue that you wind up tying your sense of self-worth to a longterm project if it's your only thing going and that you can also become too stubborn about not murdering your darlings when you need to.

From behind a VPN, he joins forums and places like Reddit and Facebook, wherever there are moderators and whenever his opinion gets censored he sends a message to the Moderator demanding that the post be restored, or he is going to kill someone.

So the first Moderator doesn't take him seriously, until a couple of weeks later, under a new account, the crazy antagonist sends the Moderator a link to a story about someone that was recently murdered, and the antagonist says ""YOU did that.""  But the Moderator doesn't believe him.  So a few weeks pass and then a different new account sends a link to a different murder, only this murder has moderator's screen name spray painted on the sidewalk next to the body.

Now the Moderaator is terrified because they realize that two people have been killed by this lunatic.  And so after that it's a cat &amp; mouse game between the murderer and the moderator and the police, where the killer demands that his posts get published or else ""he'll kill again"" and so the Moderator posts them and suddenly all the racists and white supremacists find that they agree with him and he becomes an underground, cult hero.

So now the Moderator and the Police of conflicted.  Do they continue to allow the guy to post, in order to gather information on his identity, his location and to prevent other murders, while he becomes more and more popular with the racist underclass?  Or do they censor his speech, and provoke more murders and also invite ""copycat"" murderers who adopt his methods and also insist that their speech be published or more people will be killed.

I can't decide if I should limit the story to just a bunch of ""nobodies"", or if politicians and corporate executives start getting killed, such as Brian Doors, the billionaire inventor of the operating system ""Openings"".  On the one hand, the standard drama of cops vs. bad guy with the Moderator being a hot &amp; sexy milf with a slight drinking problem and living by her lonely self in a small cabin in the moutains with nothing to do all day long except Moderate Reddit, but also the idea of killing-off the Glitterati is appealing, after all who doesn't like to see Billionaires being burned alive inside their limosines while Frank Sinatra sings ""I Did It My Way"" in the background.  Or the Censorship Killer shooting some Billionaire playboy's trophy wife sideways through both of her breast implants, so that they deflate and squirt twin fountains of blood and saline through the front of her white bikini top?"

I came across this quote and it bothered me because first of all, I can't understand wtf he is saying. Check this out

""We ought to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away and a smaller part of it is left, but also that if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain whether the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension of things and retain the power of contemplation that strives to acquire the knowledge of the divine and the human. For if he shall begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite and whatever else there is of the kind will not fail; but the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty, and clearly separating all appearances, and considering whether a man should now depart from life, and whatever else of the kind absolutely requires a disciplined reason, all this is already extinguished. We must make haste then, not only because we are daily nearer to death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first.”

Personally, I can't read many books I took an interest in because they're written using a combination of words I have to look up and a weird style that would sound odd if spoken out loud or in conversation, so I don't really make the connect and the sentence doesn't completely make sense to me. Basically, out of my reading level.

This sentence:
""For if he shall begin to fall into dotage, perspiration and nutrition and imagination and appetite and whatever else there is of the kind will not fail"" 
Is one of those sentences weird sentences.

Only thing is that I don't know how to write enemies to lovers well and I'm not sure how to go about it.

For reference, I write paranormal romance.

And for this, I wanted to make a dragon story with enemies to lovers. My current idea is the FMC is the princess of one dragon family, and every dragon has their own mate. But at the moment, her mate is AWOL. 

An unsuspecting attack from another dragon family leaves her an orphan, and her evil cousin overthrows her to take the crown. So, she's now left with nothing.

One dragon from the clan who attacked, the MMC, rescues her. My thinking at the moment-she hates him for killing her mother. He is mad at her because she's the descendant of the prince who assaulted his mother.

But continuing past this I'm a bit stuck. The reason for him to hate her isn't that strong, and continuing their anger for each other while trying to train and get stronger to overcome some future obstacles while adding in clues to eventually overcome their misunderstandings and fall in love is not coming to me easily.

(I'm a blind writer, I'm not good with outlining. I like things to come to me as I write).

I find I have an easier time making my sentences flow better if it's followed by something the character's done, as I have a real struggle with mental visualisation and need to act out the action irl to get my brain cinema going.

How did the treaties imposed on the native Americans affect their culture and behavior? How did this affect their actions?

The treaties imposed on the Native Americans affected their culture so that they became impatient and resorted to violence and a government similar to those of the westerners. This is because when the treaties moved the Indians around, helpless, they likely felt that their god had changed, as shown when a creek man named Speckled Snake, more than a hundred years old reacted to Andrew Jackson’s policy of removal (a relocation policy) “... Then \[the white man\] became our Great Father. … \[A\]nd he said ‘Get a little farther, lest I tread on thee.’” They embraced their new god, though not fond of him. They recognized his power, yet hated it. So they did what human nature pushed them to do. They grew impatient, and that added on with being surrounded by whites made them not consider their decision that deeply, to mold to western civilization. They abandoned their traditional culture and custom of not having a government, and built up a new society with farmers, blacksmiths, and more.

According to *the People's History of the United States* “Northern political sympathizers with the Indians seemed to be fading away, preoccupied with other issues.” Zinn(141) Before Jackson became president “White men were allowed to visit the Indians communities and Indians often were guests in white homes”Zinn(135), and once Jackson became president he used the western poor settlers and turned them, such that they saw the Indians as parasites to the land, and that they must leave in order to supply opportunity to the whites. This is demonstrated when Jackson made no real attempt to stop westerners from mining for gold on Indian territory once it was discovered. As the Northerners stopped caring, the Indians lost most of their sympathizers. Now that there was no western resistance Jackson began to move the Indians westward as the U.S developed westward. Dale van Every in the book *The Disinherited* tells what this meant to the Indians “He had never fully grasped the principle establishing private ownership of land as any more rational than private ownership of air but he loved the land with a deeper emotion than could any proprietor.” In short, the Indians did not know enough to see that their rights were violated, that this was not fair. Jackson took advantage of this and in 1828 the federal government signed a treaty with the Cherokees for their permanent home, too barren for white settlers, 17,000 Cherokees were surrounded by 900,000 whites in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. This pressured them to become impatient and mimic the western civilization. Zinn sums this up on page 136 of *A People's History of the United States*: “they were beginning to resemble that civilization the white men spoke of.” It is very likely that Jackson intended this, as it is better to have control over a people similar to the majority, compared to a minority.

With the stage set, surrounded by whites and on a barren land unable to support their previous lifestyle, change was to come. It was inevitable. According to *A People's History of the United States*, “the Cherokees decided that survival required adaptation to the white man's world”: they became farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, and property owners. According to a 1826 census mentioned in *the People’s History of the United States* there was 22,000 cattle, 7,600 horses, 46,000 swine, 726 looms, 2,488 spinning wheels, 172 wagons, 2943 plows, 10 saw mills, 31 grist mills, 62 blacksmith shops, 8 cotton machine, and 18 schools.

The first apparent change came in the form of language. Cherokee language was soft and poetic, a form of art. Now with the influence of the whites, their chief, Sequoyah invented a written language more similar to that of the whites which was used in a new newspaper called the *Cherokee Phoenix*. Ever since this era, the Indians were strong believers in the rejection of government, but now this began to change. This attempt to win over the westerners was caught by Jackson who informed them that any independent government apart from the U.S would not be recognized by the U.S, and had no power. According to *the People’s History of the United States* “some Cherokees had apparently given up on nonviolence three chiefs who signed the removal treaty were found dead.” This shows the real extent that the change had gone to.

The Indians before and after Jackson were different. Jackson had managed to use deception and trickery to take advantage of the Indian’s difference of culture to squeeze them into a barren land surrounded by white settlers on what had originally been their land. They did what any sane group would do: adapt. It is unfortunate that Jackson controlled this adaptation and the Indian culture had to go through such a drastic change, and that their culture barely survives today."

2602,Pashahlis,Discussion,19,writing,1627143728,"Struggling to come up with my two protagonist's ""want"" and ""need"" for their character arcs &gt; ""Want"" describes something the protagonist thinks he wants to be happy in life, while the ""need"" describes what the character actually needs to be happy in life.

&gt; For example Scrooge thinks he only needs money to be happy in life, while in truth he needed human companionship.

Anyway, I am struggling to come up with my two protagonist's want and need.

The first protagonist is a human who was adopted by an old lord of a winged race that has lost the ability to fly and now lives scattered on various big airships throughout the world.

The lord has the dream of re-uniting the tribes, but he is murdered at the beginning of the book. But he did install the same kind of drive to unite the tribes in his human adoptive child.

So the child, now a young woman, does everything she can to unite the tribes, both because she thinks they cannot survive otherwise and to fulfill her late adoptive fathers dream. She does this using political and military strategy and cunning, that she was taught by him.

Throughout the book she will have to make hard choices and also alienate a lot of people because she chooses to advance her plan of uniting the people rather than helping her allies. That will cost her dearly later on.

But in the end she will triumph and have united the tribes, as well as given them back the ability to fly, which gave her the much needed support in the populace as she is not a member of their race, thanks to protagonist number two.

Protagonist number two is actually a member of said race. She always dreamed of flying and so became the apprentice of a human mage who she wanted to know from how to give her people the ability to fly back. Unfortunately her master also died at the start of the book. So now she is doing her own magical experiments and also uses her rare magical powers to help her people, which gets her the attention of protagonist number one. 

Protagonist number one wants to enlist her and help her fullfill the dream, because she wants to use it to gather the much needed support she needs to become leader of the United tribes, but also starts forming a non-romantic friendship with the other young woman.

Unfortunately I have not quite figured out much yet in terms of the second protagonists character arc. 

In both cases however I lack a clear want and need. For the first protagonist one might think her want is uniting the tribes and her need is something else, but neither do I jo what that need could be nor do I want it to be that way because I do want her to succeed in the end and unite the tribes.

And for protagonist number two U am even more unsure.

You guys got any ideas?

There are some ideas already about acceptance, forgiveness, or redemption and how she can achieve any of them without having to accomplish her adoptive fathers project, but the logical end of all those arcs would be her abandoning her role as a leader and I don't want that."

**Naturalistic:** Learning through consuming whatever stories you most enjoy in any media and writing whatever you wish to write about. Giving yourself the freedom to explore anything and use it. 

**Technical:** Learning by studying grammatical rules, nonfiction books on writing, and any methods that directly speak about craft. Become an excellent craftsmen and use this ability to create great works.

**Lifestyle:** Learning by leading a really interesting life and having great stories. Create such a vivid lifestyle that you are never short of content to write about.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of having a villain who was originally a nice and sociable person. But after years of being ignored and disregarded by everyone in his life, he becomes bitter and vengeful. He also eventually realizes that his entire life takes place in a TV Show, which causes him to have a nihilistic view on everything, and creates a TV remote-like device that helps him alter the reality of his universe. He experiments with the lives of other characters, killing them off to see what happens, and then going back in time and making it like it never happened. He wants nothing more than to see everyone around him suffer. However, I want him to be redeemed in the end. I don't know exactly how yet.

&amp;#x200B;

My inspiration for this character is Rob from *The Amazing World of Gumball* and Flowey from *Undertale*.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The story:**

Briefly said, the story follows multiple main characters and storylines. Every chapter is centered around another character. This way I am trying to show the same situations from multiple sides, showing how people came to decisions or how certain characters perceive the same situation differently.

This has a lot of advantages and disadvantages. One big downside is that one character's chapter might end in week 2 of the story while the next chapter starts in week 1 again. This might get confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

**The decision:**

Right now every chapter centers around a different character. I am thinking of changing that. I am thinking of making the entire story chronological, switching between characters in the chapters. This would completely overhaul the entire structure of the story. It would do good and bad things for the whole and I am wondering what other people think.

A good thing it would do is make the story as a whole more clear. A bad thing it would do is remove suspense. Right now a cliffhanger can be paid off several chapters later. With the new approach, that cliffhanger has to be paid off in the next chapter.

What do you guys think? Thank you very much in advance for considering to help me!"
2607,AngryFoodieLA, ,6,writing,1627141983,"Crohn's Blog or Crohn's Book - Would love some advice. Hi Friends, as briefly as I can put it. I started blogging in May 2021, documenting the last two years of my life with Crohn's Disease (which has been hellacious, to say the least), and while the blog is relatively new, I have already been approached by a publisher. I should mention I used to write for television a lifetime ago, and was represented by one of the big agencies in Los Angeles (horrendous experience). My question, I'm terrible at self-promotion and Instagram users, while sending me gushing notes about how much they love it, I'm nevertheless not getting traction (they seem to prefer a single sentence before moving on). So - my question - do I continue with the blogging or write the book (I have a year's worth of material already written out - polishing would be most necessary). Thank you in advance for your input. I'm leaning toward just banging out the book, as I don't think I'll reach the massive audience on social media that I hope to help. As an example, 30 Million people just last year Googled Crohn's Disease. That's an enormous number and I don't think posting to SM will get me anywhere near those numbers of readers.

I've been writing for, I don't know, seven years now? Among my works, there are five novels, dozens of short stories and a few novelas, plus a shit ton of unfinished manuscripts.

However, it's been two years since I finished my last novel and I haven't been able to finish even a short story ever since. Writer's block? Maybe, but I think I've just reached a point where I had to confront the reality: publishing is hard (none of my works were accepted for professional publishing) and I just wasn't there yet in terms of quality. This shit hit me hard.

Recently, I've been trying to find a way out. I compiled a list of writers that serve as inspiration for me. I want to read some books by these authors and study their works before I try to write again. I believe that this will help me improve the quality of my work and avoid more disappointment.

Recently, I’ve been more aware of how much I enjoy writing….or just creating in general. I really would like to start working on a series, but I have absolutely no experience. On a daily basis, I think about this series and it keeps growing into something I need to get on paper. Before I start that, I’d like to do some work to build up my writing skills while also getting some work out there for a portfolio. 
 
From what I’ve read, these are the steps I should be taking. 

1• create a blog or a website for my work 
(Any suggestions on a great site to use?)

2• find a niche 
(Music and film)

3• find a brand name 
(I’ve been struggling with this one, should this be a name I use for the website and email? Do I have to take steps to make it an LLC?)

4• use a site or app to make invoices 
(I’m going to have to find a class for anything involving finances with this, because I don’t even know where to start)

So, music is my number one passion. I love discovering new music and supporting my local artists. I think a great start is to write for them. I have an artist in mind I want to begin this new work with, but I’m struggling to get everything going or where exactly to begin. Any tips, suggestions, sites, or YouTube videos would help so much! Also I apologize in advance, this is on mobile so I’m not sure how the text will turn out."

My first choice was something in the physical sciences but it seems like my grades were relatively lower against all the others vying for it. 

When I was younger, I was often praised for my skills in English and speaking, but now I feel so mediocre. I always envisioned myself in a communications course as a kid but as I got older and more conscious of how I was underperforming in something I used to be the best at, I feel like I forced myself into a fever dream to like STEM. With chemistry and physics, I was either right or wrong, like a binary. But with writing, it feels like a spectrum. It's more personal, I'm more responsible for what I put out, and I feel like I have this immense fear of being perceived as someone in the lower end of that scale. 

I heard from the upperclassmen that the course requires a lot of written outputs (technical and creative) and from the looks of it, most of my coursemates entered journalism competitions during high school and garnered awards. I used to be in radio broadcasting (quit after a year because of commitments to an elected position) but there were times when I would record myself speaking and it sounded like I was choking on my words. I feel like I won't be able to excel or stand out among the others :( 

I think I write decently; I'm able to string words together, use proper grammar, and convey my thoughts but I don't think I've ever considered my writing to be captivating, compelling, or concise.

...  


Though small, Ithica simply was not to be fucked with. Usually, people found this out the hard way, well - assholes found out the hard way. She made a point of living her post-collapse life independently, teaching herself a wide range of skills which, before, she'd never have considered learning. One of these skills in particular was the one of which she was the most proud: killing. It's not that she enjoyed it, or went out of her way to do it, rather, she had grown confident in her ability to tell who needed to die, why, and how to go about it. All without telegraphing her intent.

After a couple months of getting her ass kicked in fights over food or supplies, she'd become better prepared to take a hit. She'd grown accustomed to a pop in the face and a kick to the ribs before she realized killing was part of the package once society vanished. Her first kill came and went in a snap, like taking a picture. 

On the night in question, a couple strangers approached Ithica as she sat by her campfire. They gave her the usual pleasantries: ""hey."", ""how have things been out this way?"", ""Is the fishing good out here?"", which, to her dismay, gave way to things more along the lines of: ""Spare some food?"", ""Yer husband out checking traps?"", and ""How long you been alone?"" Her answers were obviously 'incorrect', so these lowlives got to grabbing. They were going to take what they wanted, or so they thought, at least.

What they hadn't counted on was Ithica's filet knife. She kept it for its intended purpose, being that she tended to stick to the rivers. Luckily, not ten minutes before, she'd just finished cleaning a couple gorgeous rainbow trout, so it was still sitting on a rag next to her. With lust in their eyes, they'd missed it despite it being out in the open.

To make a long story short, after a few moments of wrestling, a couple punches, and an attempted chokehold from one of the near skeletal assailants, the much better-fed Ithica took that diligently sharpened filet knife and left both of them leaking all over the leaf litter - and each other - as they collided in their blind flight. They fell on the spot from thorough gashes to their throats. Only seconds had passed from the initial grab, and that was her first kill: a double.

Since then, she'd lost count. Or at least, she'd passed the point of being able to wager a decent estimate; the idea of keeping count had lost its meaning as she acclimated to this totally and drastically thorough change of epoch.

Some time later, during the cold season in the Montana Rocky region, she'd found herself east a ways, out by her destination. She'd been out to the old FEMA warehouse a time or two before, and it had been worthwhile, given FEMA's massive food effort after the war. The kicker? That was the summer before last, and people knew about it, as evidenced by the tagging and hobo signs she found on her second visit. 

Because it was dusk on a dreary, overcast day, and the windows were mostly overgrown, meaning that, unfortunately, the interior of the warehouse was without illumination. The darkness was solid and impressive. A strange quiet hung in the air, almost as a presence rather than as an absence as one would normally appraise such silence. The air was close, and it felt oddly warm. Ithica clicked her little convenience store LED light and got to work searching for intact totes. The dust in the air resembled pelagic snow as it drifted slowly in the weak current. Cluttered empty totes littered the area, and the sheer amount of rat droppings near the successfully compromised packaging was a good sign. It meant more of these boxes might have contained food than she had assumed; after all, some of these messes had been made since her last visit.

The shelf space in the warehouse went up seven levels, and there were maybe forty or fifty rows arranged in various orientations. For ease in the emergency, each joint in the shelving had a built-in ladder, dumbwaiter, and small catwalks out in front of each level. She knew it was unlikely that everything had been cleared out, so she took her time and thought about what may have attracted the least attention. One new sight was a handful of skeletal remains. She found them outside a makeshift house built into some of the shelf units, going all the way to the top, suggesting people set up in the warehouse permanently. The ones she found outside the house were on their faces. As she examined them, she found bullet holes in their backs; they'd been gunned down. She turned her attention to the little home, and silently moved aside the fitted sheet the people rigged as a door. Peering inside she found three more skeletons huddled in the farthest corner of the first story. Her heart broke when she realized the middle, larger skeleton had two, smaller skeletons curled up under its arms on either side. This was a mother and her children. Their skulls were all heavily damaged. 

Pushing her thoughts aside and dabbing her eyes, she left and kept on her search. Finally, she'd found jars of baby food under a knocked over pile of CPAP supplies (for the rest of her life, she'd thank the impulse that cause her to sift through medical supplies), and began filling her pack. Riding a wave of serotonin after finding a huge amount of mashed bananas, she'd almost missed the faint, yet distinct clatter that issued from somewhere on the other end of the warehouse. She froze. The still air hung about her head, the wind rustled the aluminum roof, all the while wailing ghostly tunes that seemed to lament its new reality. Against her better judgement, Ithica crept towards the sound. There came another. She almost froze again, but she steeled herself and silently quickened her pace. 

""Hey, Cali, I think I found them."" She heard a gruff voice call out, which startled her.  
""Oh shit, are you sure?"" Came a second voice from just a little further off. They seemed to be in different rows. There was a pause, the answer didn't come immediately.  
""Yeah...ah fuck. Yeah, this is them...looks like somebody lit them up."" The first voice sounded disappointed, but not sad.   
""God *dammit*. That's gotta mean Thomlinson's guys know where the rest of the insulin is."" the second one fretted, devolving into a string of curse words in both Spanish and English, for good measure.   
""You know *that's* right. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Now all we can do is hope none of these folks talked."" 

Ithica had heard enough. She sensed pay-off at the end of this tunnel, so she resolved to trail them. She shadowed them as they left the warehouse, and then she slipped around back and beat them to the treeline, where she watched them, keeping up the whole time. They were armed. One had a Kalashnikov, the other had a hunting rifle. Their clothes were well worn, but not tattered. Some of their articles of clothing were tac-wear, others were simply utilitarian; clearly they were working with what they had, but were prepared enough to dress for the job they wanted.

There was nothing to do but wait until they arrived to their destination, which, after about six hours, they did: a clearing in an obscure part of the woods filled with tents. They had three carriages made from what looked like stripped down Nissan pickup trucks, as well as several horses. There was a water collection tarp, and in lieu of a visible fire, there was a good amount of smoke issuing from a chimney atop the largest tent in the center of the camp. They seemed to be nomads. She'd estimated that this camp might comfortably support around twenty people."

I want to write a “Action-Horror” story, what is the best advice you have? The current idea I have for the story is a story in my “LOMOND” series of Loud House horror fics and an AU to Destroy897’s “Red Loud” story. This installment in the series is about Lomond, a mutant killer loud sibling with superpowers brutally killing Russian soldiers, knocking Russian planes out of the sky and destroying Russian tanks by physically running into them. The reason why he is doing this and working together with the other loud siblings is just to protect Ronnie Anne and Lincoln, who are the few people he love and would never kill. One notable ability LOMOND has is being able to make hundreds of people start slowly and painfully melting, which he uses in this story several times against insane amounts of Russian soldiers.

What is the best advice you have when writing gore? What are some other things that I should consider when writing this story? One thing I am concerned about is that I accidentally make Lomond too brutal against the Russians, the reason why I think this would be a problem is because I think that if I show too many horrific things happening to the Russian soldiers, the readers might start rooting for them.

I am only eighteen, so I'm aware that my relatively scant life experience is likely a damper on my ability to write unique and emotionally evocative pieces, and that this flaw can only be overcome by the natural accumulation of the small lessons that life has to offer. 

I first realized that I wanted to be a professional author of fiction in high school. Before this epiphany, I was not an avid reader of novels, so I did not have a cemented background with the craft as many might when beginning their quest in the discipline. As a result, I am constantly worrying about the deleterious effects that my late start could have had on my potential to write in an advanced and entertaining fashion. I would also like to mention that I do suffer from intrusive thoughts and obsessions associated with these anxieties, which compel me to engage in a whole host of different rituals in an attempt to bury them. 

Lately, I've been trying to write with revived regularity now that summer has flowered and the burden of at-home learning is in the past, but every time that I sit down at my workspace to begin a work session, I often leave with diminished confidence in my abilities. Every sentence, nay, every word that I inscribe upon the page feels hollow and unimaginative. Vibrant platters of emotion fill my head, though I can never seem to describe them in a way that is satisfying to myself, as if I can't retrieve the ""correct"" words from my active vocabulary. Eventually, the self-loathing becomes insufferable and I just return to my reading to hide from the torture.

Most who read my writing are supposedly captivated by what I've constructed, but I'm at the point that I just don't believe them. I doubt that they're intentionally exercising deception, but I've always been regarded as the ""English kid"" in my class, so it could be that their expectations are contaminating their actual perception.

In the midst of everything, that one question always rings painfully in my head.

What if I'm just not intelligent enough?

Are any of my insecurities a part of the typical experience, or should I just concede and accept that the hardware upstairs may be too shoddy for my ambitions? My memory is my most prominent shortcoming. There are a few words that my brain always tries to reuse, and I have to make a conscious effort to suppress them so that I can write without using repetitive diction. 

I apologize if this reads like an edgy tangent. Nobody close to me is a fellow writer, and I didn't think that these concerns would be met with understanding if I had presented them before my companions and acquaintances."

Not only is the profession completely unregulated, but the process of determining who should edit your work can be very unclear and intimidating. We want to offer a few suggestions to help those who may be looking for an editor. 

The first and most important step is to get a sample of any prospective editor's work. The old saying “show, don’t tell” is especially true here. The next crucial step in hiring an editor is to make sure your work is protected by a contract. Here is a sample of a standard editing contract. This should give you some idea of what to expect (or ask for) in a contract with your editor.  [https://www.editors.ca/hire/agreement-template-editing-services](https://www.editors.ca/hire/agreement-template-editing-services)  

Before signing any agreement, make sure you and the editor fully understand what their proposed service entails. For instance, an editor may suggest a developmental edit of your work, but be sure to get clarification about what that means to them and for your work specifically. We have definitions of our services written for our authors to review beforehand.  [https://www.clevereditors.com/services/](https://www.clevereditors.com/services/) 

Finally, don’t be afraid to get quotes from multiple editors. If it doesn’t feel right, trust your gut! Please feel free to DM me any time if you have any questions about editing. I’m always happy to support new authors, even if they don’t require any editing services. We’re all in this together!"

I am writing a light novel that is yet to be named, i wanted to call it something in Japanese because the main action takes place in Japan. What i have so far is Hitori No Guntai which means One Man Army.
The story is about a 7 year old boy whose parents are struggling monetarily, so they take money from a loan shark multiple times, this loan shark is a man driven by greed that yearns for power. He can't achieve the goals he has in mind because he is dying of a heart disease and he is in need of a heart transplant. Luckily (or unluckily) this boy's big sister has a compatible heart with his so he takes her away by force and steals her heart as payment. The parents are destroyed emotionally and start to lose it to the point where the mother leaves the house and jumps off a bridge, and the father hangs himself in the living room, leaving the boy all by himself. At the same time, in the world of the Japanese Mafia, there is a change of leadership, the old Yakuza boss leaving his seat to his son, but that change in power is shortlived because our loan shark with his newfound heart kills him and takes his place. The old Yakuza boss is emotionally destroyed aswell, but using the remnants of his power he gathers as much information on this loan shark and discovers the boy. He goes on to adopt that kid and together they plan to take revenge and kill that loan shark for the families he destroyed.
For the next 12 years the boy is being trained to become a killing machine capable of fighting tens of people at once. 
The little boy is haunted by his sister's ghost because he feels that everything that happened in the past was his fault.

I've thought of possible names with meanings behind the characters:
The main character - Azrael (Angel of Death)
The old yakuza boss - Solomon (Wise King)
The loan shark - Dearil (call of death)

In the current series I'm writing, which has elements of magical realism, the antagonist in the first arc is a young woman who suddenly acquires a lot of power.

The thing is she's not portrayed as an exotic demon/witch figure like Carrie or some wicked stepmother (we can discuss the politics of that representation separately) - she seems like a relatively normal college girl who simply ends up acquiring too much power.

Our protagonist, a man, older (looks in his 40s) who is centuries old, ends up killing her in a rather gruesome end scene - to stop her. He is also morally ambiguous but we are on his side in the current arc.

Have you had issues with this before around uncomfortable arcs around gender or race (in this case both characters are more or less white) in your own writing? How did you deal with that?

He even loves to worship and spend time with God. But he has a secret that nobody knows about. Jake heads to college and starts his first year. But what will happen when he meets Faith Brooks? In that case, who will tell?

  I am thinking more of Saving Jake, Forbidding Love, And God Forgave, or something that will catch the readers eye. 

  If you can help me with titles, I would really appreciate it. I even have the perfect cover, just wanting to change the title. Thank you!"
2693,CrypticWeirdo9105,Advice,2,writing,1627070251,"I need ideas for an aspect of my story... Basically, at one point in my story, three people get kidnapped by terrorists and put in prison, and get tortured every day for information, and I'm trying to figure out how they'd communicate secretly with each other and break out.

For some context: The prison is underground, I think made of stone or clay or something like that, with individual cells for each person surrounded by metal bars. The inmates stay in the cells at all times, with a squat toilet in the corner surrounded by flimsy curtains. There's a guard standing in view of the cell at all times. The food and/or water is thrown in between the bars, and the only time the door is opened is when the torturers come in. There are a few basic items in the cell, nothing sharp or heavy that can be used as a weapon. Prisoners aren't allowed to communicate with each other, and they can't when they're trapped in individual cells all the time, hence the need for some sort of secret communication system that they devise. I was thinking tapping out Morse code, but it's inefficient and it's not like the prisoners would know it anyway.

So, does anyone have any ideas for how the prisoners will communicate and break out?"

2695,tate346,Discussion,5,writing,1627069291,"Examples of uncomfortable plot arcs done well? How to work with them? In the current series I'm writing, which has elements of magical realism, the antagonist in the first arc is a young woman who suddenly acquires a lot of power. She ends up becoming a bully who ends up trying to take over everything. The thing is she's not portrayed as an exotic demon/witch figure like Carrie or some wicked stepmother (we can discuss the politics of that representation separately) - she seems like a normal college girl who simply ends up acquiring too much power.  

Our protagonist, a male, older (looks in his 40s) who is centuries old, ends up killing her in a rather gruesome end scene - to stop her. He is also morally ambiguous but we are on his side in the current arc. 

Are there examples of such ""uncomfortable"" arcs done well or even done terribly? Have you had issues with this before around gender or race (in this case both characters are more or less white) in your own writing? How did you deal with that? 

Done well: Gone Girl but it's received plenty of flake as well. 

Done terribly examples: Ayn Rand no-consent scene in fountainhead. 

Neither: One obvious parallel is Glory from Buffy. BUT our protagonist is female. 

Other details: I am a man. There are many other ""heroic"" female/non-binary characters in the story - in the subsequent arcs they become the protagonists."

Somewhere in the Peloponnese (southern Greece) there was a peaceful ant nest, workers working, builders building, soldiers guarding and males banging the queen. Until the day came where two human children surprise-attacked the queendom, it wasn’t like the usual attacks that damage the main gate and light casualties inflicted. The children were determent to eradicate the colony and they came armed. It was a disaster in which the colony would never recover from.

3 days after the attack, Leon and his recon squad of 4 ants returned back from their long expedition and saw their once beloved city in ruins. Not a single ant to be seen apart from them, the main gate—that big gate that stood in the face of countless attacks both from mammals  and other rival enemy ants—was in its place a massive whole as if it was shoveled or struck by a meteor sent by Zeus himself. 

Leon was horrified, and in a state of shock, him and the squad hurried to dig from an entrance to the tunnels to see what’s left of the colony, maybe the queen and their comrades were still alive… they hoped.  

Nothing but corpses and debris, Leon rushed to his house--or accurately what’s left of his house—in panic and there he found what he wished to not find: the dead bodies of Nicomodors and Appollonia… his two young siblings. 

The squad gathered just outside the colony to discuss what to do now. Kriton—the Captain’s adjutant, known for his immense physical strength and hard work as well as honesty—proposed they should head to the food stocks and scavenge the city to resupply then Xenophanes—master of tracking—could trace any evidence of ants that survived. Captain Oedipus had another idea…"

When I was a kid, I had several almost fully developed novels in my head, but I never actually started to write them down because I simply wasn’t that familiar with computers and how to use them, and, let’s be honest, it’s kind of hard to write a whole novel on normal paper. 

I have a notebook where I can write down ideas for novels and reuse them at one point or another and I have a whole page dedicated to the ideas of my past self. 
Not gonna lie, most of them suck, but they still deserve a special place in my heart, especially the first novel I ever thought of. 

Now, a few years later, I’ve finished my first actual book and I keep thinking about that first “novel”. I think that it would be kinda fun to expand and edit the story, simply for nostalgic reasons. Maybe I could make a decent book out of it... 
But on the other hand, I’m a little scared that I’ll ruin the story by reimagining it. It’s always been so special for me and I don’t want to lose that feeling."

I've been working on a novel for a bit over a year or so now, though I've only started to seriously write last winter. This is the first time I'm writing this much, but I don't want to procrastinate any longer. I've been inspired by my boyfriend, as he is a writer.
I just want to learn how to write better, impactul speech. 

I'll leave an example, it's from the end of my novel. It's a very morally grey area, and I want to show that in the speech as well. I don't want the character to seem either right or wrong. Though I want the reader to understand where he's coming from. My character ends up murdering his love interest, despite having the best intentions at heart. Up until this point he thought he was doing the right thing, but seeing the lifeless corpse, he simply didn't feel happy as he thought he would:








“I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry. “ he kept repeating those words, again and again. Even so, his hand wasn’t getting warmer. Even if he was crying his heart out, his eyes weren’t opening. He continued to beg for forgiveness, before tears just stopped coming out altogether. He felt dizzy, his mouth was dry, his eyes couldn’t focus on anything. 

“I just don’t get it... I really don’t get it... What was the right thing? I don’t get it at all. I was only trying to... Do the right thing. I never meant for this to happen. Why did it happen? Why aren’t you saying anything to me...? How was I supposed to protect you otherwise?!... I really don’t know... But it feels like I’ve done so many bad things. Still, I don’t regret doing this fully. I know it’s bad but I just don’t get it. I can’t decide what’s right and what’s wrong... I’m just a man, how am I supposed to know?! I just... Wanted you to be safe and happy. That’s all. Wasn’t everything I did good because of that?! Then why is everyone saying I’m a monster? Why is everyone crying? Why am I crying?! Why am I not happy?! Tell me... Please... “ he let out a deep breath, looking up to his closed eyes.

2718,potuyer,Resource,10,writing,1622375374,"My tips and tricks for Writing. First of i am no expert and i haven't published anything yet,what i am going to put in here is what i personally do and use for writing.Hope it helps you all:

0.Love/Art:don't do it for money writing like many things is and art and needs to be taken care of and because you like it.If you make a living with it and love it then i got nothing to say about that.On the other hand if you are But  it for greed,money and recognition is sad and may affect your writing badly.

1.Shower or Bath :they are both good but...what is a shower without something to write the cool ideas that go through your head during that time?.I recommend you take a notebook(small or big) and a pencil and write them you may end up wasting cool concepts without them.And can write for literall hours inside of there without feeling burned  out.

2.Paper and pencil:You'll be more focus and less distracted and your ideas will flow like thay are meant to(you can correct them later).

3.Ideas:Write everything you consider worth it for your story and get rid or save the ones you don't consider worth using(for that story,save them for another).

4.Lore and World-Building:The most important two as without this two you will have nothing more than a flat,shallow,empty boring world.
Take your time to develop this two as they are the main ones that will defined your world and characters that are leaving on it.

5.Plot:if u don't want to go blind and be like 'now what do i do i am stuck' or 'where do i take my characters now' and many more.First of structure your plot in a big simple  scheme,it dosn't have to be a big deal as long as you understand it.Once you done that write subplots inside that scheme(act 1:subplot x,y,z... etc have in account that this is where your story and character will go so plan it well every single detail).For example,let's say you put war(As act 1),then you will have to put something like this(within another point inside the Act 1,lets call it negotiations(subplot) for example):

‐Character development.( inside it or with lines,conversation 1,go to point 2 etc.And write on these  points what you want it or how you want to go and develpp)
‐Conversation.( same as first use as many subplots  as you need)

And focus in making  the development and conversations  you want,this way your story and world will become more structured and solid.Eorks for your world too.You can put as many as you want or need as long as it is solid.

6.Character and its development:Do a simple scheme of how you want it to be and follow it puting the points like stated in five,also be carefull with the age.As for its development you can change the character scheme a little(example proud to humble or conscious because of...) through the story and apply it carefully.
But as always you will need to have it all planned out so you don't go blind in his/ her development and story.

7.Draw: this will boost your creativity a lot as well as give you ideas for many characters you can write stories of or about, plus you will relax your mind and pribably  enjoy it a lot.
You don't have to be a picasso i litterally started drawing like three months ago and created about fourty characters just by drawing(back stories included).

8.Writing on a secondary lenguage: read a lot of it and take notes if you  needed and use a dictionary,it will help you a lot plus boost your vocabulary.

9.Diaologue and actions within the world: You need to have fully polished points 4 and 5 as well as 6 remember that you have to be the literal character and feel how he/ she will feel during that time as well as how he/ she will act in certain situations(use the character scheme/plot scheme).

10.Country contrasts/realm contrasts and differences:Use the intro for this in case your character is going to be travelling a lot and focus a lot in the rules,culture of the realm and the atmosphere it has.

11.Poetry: it helps a lot to ease the main and describe things with a different more beautifull tone and it helps for hardcore and explicit scenes(in case you want to write that kinda stuff) as well as making your stories flawless and beautifull.

12.Word repetition:Be carefull with this as it hurts the story and the readers experience a lot to get rid of this focus a lot in points four,eight,eleven and five.It will help you get rid of this and make it flawless.

13.Prologue and start up problems:Don't be bother much with it as it may change  a lot(personall example here:when i first wrote the prologue of what was to become my story it was awfull.The ideas where great but it lacked a plot,world and lore to back it up,i have wrote it twice since then.The second one around four months ago and the last one a few weeks ago.
The difference?:the first was awfull,the second had some lore and world to back it up but was missing the plot.
As for the last one was almost perfect it had the lore,the world and a plot that made sense and will surely keep you reading.
How did i do it?i took my time,did the points from above planned some things here and there and it worked.
So don't be scare if it your prologue dosn't flow like you meant at first,pribably you are missing some of the above points like i did.

14.Person/Character POV:I recomend using third for both thoughts and,feelings and actions,is the easiest to use besides first.Anyway use what you feel comfortable with.

15.Visions/character dream description: easy peasy,i had seen some author use ""this"" instead of 'this' or even a line when the text ended.Something like this —.
Let's say your character goes to sleep on a cold night,you can either start with ""this"" if it is all well described and planned or a line— if u feel more comfortable.Up to you as long as it is understandable and flows with the story.

16.Intro of magical creature to main character or reader:For this one i recommend you mention the being yo want introduce  discretly at firts and then go more in depth.
You can use either your own legends+lore+books(the main character reads) and later on when you feel prepared introduce it more in depth.
Using ither characters riding/fighting it and have in mind that in your legends and lore( books) you will be describing it + the  cualities and abilities of it ,the rest is a cool intro/fight  and you are done.

17.Character flaws:Don,'t make your character op and without flaws and defects(not from the begining at least) instead use them to give more depth and personality to it.

That will be all,if i have more ideas i'll put them,i gotta go,hope it helps you.If you are curious of what i am working on...well i have six projects currently working on two,one everyday,the other when i can.
And as i said at the begining of the post,i am no expert but i love to write and enjoy it a lot(like most/all  of you).
Anyway i hope this helps you and gives you more insight on your projects and helps you for the better."

A common thread with web novels is that they go on forever. And because of that they avoid breaking a tension or two for too long. Or at least what feels like too long. They also have to keep that tension relevant so they dangle it above the reader's head occasionally only to go psyche, not resolving it. Until you see the next occasion they bring it up and you simply don't care anymore. I refer to this as tension wear or tension snap for lack of a better name. 

The other is winding the tension on too much for too long until you simply stop caring. It's always abrupt which is why I also call it tension snap. Again, I don't have a better name for it."

I am recently thinking of writing a full-length novel based on someone's autobiographical book. 

I'm afraid this guy had written a lot of detailed things about his life, but still, there are many untold things and aspects. 

And since I'm very interested in the subject and have read many different books on it besides the autobiography, some feeling is motivating me to write it. The premise sounds quite interesting unique to me, and there's no notable work of fiction written about it as far as I know.  

I already have a draft of the opening chapters, and as I look at them I see no hint of plagiarism or stealth. 

My main concern I that the person died only around 20 years ago, and the story is set in the mid-20th century. So it's fairly recent and I fear I break laws or rules. 

BTW, I have nothing personal or in common with the person in question. Just very interested in his story and the unique way it is related to mid-century history.

2736,Snoo_82696,Advice,31,writing,1622358780,"Criticism over head-hopping for modern times has killed all motivation for the story I was trying to write. Hello, I am a new writer here so I won't claim to be experienced with good writing. I never finished or published a book before but I was planning to write a few now to the best of my ability and I have been learning on the way. 


The story I was writing was a love story between two characters. They stay by each other's side for majority of the story and I had both characters share their thoughts and feelings on things simultaneously. This helps build the relationship between the two characters as both characters experiences are important to the characterization. 


I shared some of my writing to several people and majority criticism came from me using head-hopping. This confused me as I thought this was a normal way to write stories in 3rd person narrative. Most of the books I read as a kid and teen were all in this manner, pov from multiple characters. I was never a fan of first person as I felt is it limited but that's just my preference. 

But apparently this is wrong or maybe just wrong now because things have changed in modern times that involves POV. Most now are all first person and 3rd person limited. That's fine. If you enjoy that then more power to you.


Now without going into the whole synopsis of the story it has to do with a dire situation in which the characters are thrusted into and require each other to survive which why they are together alone majority of the story and this was heavily inspired by a book I really liked. But if I can't head hop, how am I supposed to convey both main characters at all? I can't do them individually for different chapters because that is redundant and I don't want to repeat the chapter over again only with the other character's introspection this time. I don't see why that is needed. Also I am not saying that every single thing that happens I have each character take a pause and comment on it. It just plays out like a normal narration of what the characters thoughts and actions are.

So after receiving this criticism I decided to go back and edit the story to 3rd person limited and honesty it's ruined the whole story for me. My love interest for the protagonist has no character without and pov self introspection. She might as well be a robot that does all everything the protagonist says and then falls in love with him. You get dialogue from her which I tried to convey to my best ability to of how her feelings are but it just doesn't work. It's boring. I thought I could write a love story between two interesting characters that showed their inner thoughts and experiences. And I'm frustrated I can't do that anymore because that's not what people want apparently. They just want to put themselves in the experience of one character and become attached to them which is completely fine, but that's not how I want this story to be told. 


I thought I had a decent story to tell but the story has been ruined and all the motivation is gone. I don't think I can go back. And please don't say you probably weren't going to finish it anyways. I was 90,000 words in and already had the story thought out of what I wanted it to be until this was brought up to me."

I'm working on writing the script for my graphic novel which was originally intended to be a standalone book. It has two protagonists, a man and woman, and the woman's character arc (which carries the underlying theme/message of the book) is satisfyingly completed at the end of the story. The man, however, is not so lucky, and in the epilogue he is whisked away by a mysterious entity to another world that needs his help. This is foreshadowed, intriguing, and makes sense. His arc is essentially the same as the woman's, but while hers completes the story, his expands it. His arc lends to more stories.

I've been playing with some ideas for a sequel that continues his story, but I don't have anything substantial, except for the setting. I have ideas for a conflict, but have no plot. It's vague at this point, probably because all my creative energy is focused on the book I'm actually writing right now. But I'm not sure if I'll ever write this sequel because it might never become more than an idea. I might never figure out how to make it work. Hell, this book I'm writing now is the first time I've ever developed a story to the point where it is a fully fledged cohesive narrative that I'm going write and publish. Whereas I've had lots and lots of ideas that never went any further than being just ideas.

I want it to be able to stand on its own because the sequel is not a sure thing at all, and that's why I'm wondering if leaving an open ending for one of my protagonists is a bad idea. Though like I said, the arc that carries the theme and message is still satisfyingly completed at the end."

The grim mantle O existence beckon blinded purpose, drudge seeketh meaning amongst fleeting ashes.

Deep in an ancient forest among the verdant cliffs, a shallow cave once shelter, now harbours naught but savage insects and ashes.

Drip… Drip… Drip… His mind shuddered, ears quivering. Quaking with a violent chill his body stretched and pulled with convulsions over and over like stinging waves lapping over the shores edge again and again. Akin to that of a snapping twig his eyes cracked open, swiftly greeted by an aching white light beaming brilliantly from his lap, invading his vision and enticing the agonized orbs to once again close.

Over the course of a few short bursts of throbbing pain, his eyes finally adjusted to the light – emanating from a strange clear stone shaped to the likeness that of a droplet of water. Eventually upon further inspection, he found himself sitting upright against a cave wall – legs outstretched in front of him upon the cool granite floor. Hard points and rough edges pressed in to his back, only supressed by the intervention of the tattered leather vest wrapped in a snug fit around his torso. An abnormality caught his attention, a greyed wooden shaft protruding from his chest sporting dark stains and a snapped end. Following its path like a carriage on a highway, the stains grew in quantity and in colour, forming a gradient going in to a glistening red seeping in to the grain the closer it got to him.
Embedded between his ribs was a spear, battered and bloodied, snapped at the handle and piercing his flesh. The sudden eruption of pain clawed its way through his body, causing him to jolt upwards and crumple to his side, his iron-clad body clanging upon the bumpy floor, deafening his sensitive ears and amplifying the pain tenfold. He cried out as his numb hands clamped the splintering spear, tugging and yanking at the weapon, chipping in to his ribs. He screamed in agony at the ever growing pain blasting from his torso. Desperately pulling to be rid of his suffering. 

In his struggle he twisted the blade ever so slightly, churning his insides in a violent and painful stretch – before finally ripping the embedded blade free with a wet squelch. The spear echoed with a resounding clang and rattle across the cave floor. He gasped and heaved on his side, a burning sensation rising in his throat, followed immediately by a guttural ejection of an oozing black liquid from his mouth, splattering on to the rough ground followed by the ever-increasing sting coating his throat.
Coughing and choking, he brought himself up on his hands and knees, a small bronze token dangled from a thin chain around his neck. Trembling, he slowly brought his feet beneath him swaying as tried to find his balance, crashing to the wall, leaning upon it as he slowly gathered his wits. He wrapped his gauntlet-clad fist around the token, bringing it up to his eyes. The token seemed to have etchings carved in to its brittle surface, but time – or action – had not been kind to it, all that were visible were the letters “TA”, the rest trailing in to worn shapes."

I haven't really seen it done on a particularly full scale aside from those and maybe Cirque du Freak, but it's not as though I've seen every movie and read every book. And if I broaden it to just mixing modern and medieval/fantasy together, you do see that quite a bit. Also, I've already got a project that kinda messes with this kind of concept in a weird sort of way, and even though I think I've done that one in a pretty original way, what I've currently got in mind (elves and pseudo-magic in a 1950s-ish setting) is definitely less on the original side, and I'm kinda worried that it might be starting into the realm of cliche, but for the fact that the 50s aren't a super common era to work with as far as I can tell (11.22.63 is close enough, but aside from that I've generally either seen stuff around the 70s or later or else the early 40s or before).

So, do you think a story about quasi-fantastical stuff existing in a 50s-era setting would be kinda cliche?

So I’ve been a writer for ages now—I wrote my first badly ripped off book in third grade, moved on to clumsy poetry and then on to fan fiction and finally onto novels. But never have I ever written something I’d actually read, if that makes sense. 

For example, my longest story on fanfiction. net was pretty successful; I got hundreds of positive reviews. However, whenever I tried to read over my writing, I cringed so hard. It was the kind of fanfic I would read the first few paragraphs of, decide it wasn’t worth my time, then move on. 

I have pretty high standards as a reader, and so I ended up assuming I’d never write anything that I would want to read. And it wasn’t a happy realization but I accepted it and moved on.

And then. *Finally.* 

I’ve been writing a lot recently, and I wrote the first 15k of my newest project and set it aside.

The task is to write a formal essay around Hamlet from a selection of prompts. The prompt I chose was:
&gt;""Human beings are defined by what they think, not how they &gt;act.""
I chose to write about the contrary. In essence, ""we are defined by how we act, not how we think.""

Originally, I ran into an issue with the use of pronouns in my essay. I wanted to open by generally speaking about how we (as in, humans in general) define Character. Since I was addressing humanity as a whole, it seemed right to just say, *we* do this, *we* use that, *our* actions define us, etc. 

However, since this is *Highschool* Formal Essay, of course there is absolutely no use of first-person pronouns.

So I attempted making an introductory paragraph without we/our and it was like driving nails through chalkboard trying to write something that didn't sound incredibly forced or... Like... alien(?) 

Here's what I came up with:

&gt; What defines character? Are people defined by— what they &gt;think? what they say? or is it perhaps, how they act that &gt;defines them? This is a classic philosophical question, one that has spawned...

As you can see, the first and second sentence do not connect or flow well at all. My brain just wants to go:
&gt;What defines us? Are we defined by—what we think? what &gt;we say? or is it perhaps, how we act, that defines us...

Is the first example okay? Would it be fine just to use the second version? Or should I just change it all together?

I know, it’s used as a critique to describe a character who they believe are one-dimensional, but wouldn’t that—- from a literary perspective —-be more subjective? 

Like, do different people have different definitions of what gives a character depth in media or what constitutes depth in a character?

For me, I often draft my characters around real life things. 

https://www.wired.com/story/theres-a-great-whip-spider-boom-what-gives/

Take this article for instance. It's simply one about spiders. 

But there's an interesting section near the beginning that described the woman who uncovered a certain spider. 

She loves cave dwelling and spelunking. Growing up, she'd often neglect going to the theater, and instead would go cave dwelling with her father to uncover insects and environments. 

She was then given this request to explode some came and uncovered a certain spider. 

Imagine incorporating this type of character in, say, your fantasy. 

A character interested in the history of life and certain animals or insects. Who spent their time card dwelling. You already have the makings for a compelling and unique character.

I remember once reading about a guy who spent his whole life planting a forest. It inspired this character that did something similar, and due to that, he had complete mental control of that forest, and refused to ever leave it.

If you're ever looking for how to think up unique characters, realize that everything you read and watch can be a form of inspiration. Take note of the ones that are interesting to you. Odds are you can use it as inspiration."

I am what you would consider an average dude. I aint ugly but you wouldn’t simp for me. I do some sports every once in a while, but still look a bit out of shape. I work as a scientist, and I like my work a lot but I also work too much. I play some video games to pass the time but am still searching for something fulfilling, something that’ll truly make me happy. Don’t get me wrong, I am not depressed, as an average guy my life is pretty alright most of the time. I have friends whom I value spending time with, got a pretty okay relationship with my family and can afford to take a break from life sometimes. Yet there is a significant part missing in my life, a significant other. I’d say I have a chance of getting the girl. I may only be average looking, but I can be funny and a smooth talker when I try. So why is it that I am having zero luck with the ladies? Do I not put myself out there enough? Well yes probably… but what did I gain from the times I did? Got rejected, stood up and ultimately hurt. And if I got lucky and got my place into some girls heart? Well in that case I managed to fuck it up, got dumped and all I was left with were new insecurities and new scars. So why should I do it again? Is it worth going through all this trouble? Honestly, I have no clue… I should talk to someone about my struggle, but what is it gonna achieve? Why should I put myself out there? What if there is inherently something wrong with me? Am I the reason everything romantically I am involved in fails? I guess I am an alright guy, I mean I have no trouble making friends, so why is no woman interested in me? Why am I having these self-doubts? Why can’t I just be happy…. I doubt I will ever answer these questions, but does that mean I will also never be genuinely happy? Or am I going to be happy without answering those questions? Ignoring them even maybe. But that just brings up new questions. What am I meant to do? Is there something like destiny? What makes a life meaningful or meaningless?

You know, to a teen with a lot of angst this might have sounded deep and to normal adults it just seems cringey. But what am I supposed to do? I am sitting here late at night, having had too much to drink after I gave love another chance and got stood up again. I am just living my life one day to another without seeing any way to escape the loop. Will it change once I start my studies? Once my career is going well? Will it change as soon as I meet this one person? I have no clue, and I am tired of not knowing. What am I doing this for? I am just getting myself hurt over and over again.

Once I might even have found my one true love and it seemed to work out great. There was a time where was without worries. No matter how bad things seemed to be, I knew she was by my side. Until she wasn’t anymore of course. I still blame myself for this and it took me one hell of a long time to get over the fact that we weren’t a thing anymore. Life was just missing something. But was she my one true love? I seemed to think so, but your one true love isn’t supposed to end, right?

All this writing made me question why. I am here pitying myself over some girl who stood me up today and which I barely know. Do I really like her or am I only tired of feeling lonely? Shit, here we go with the questions again. Pretty repetitive content right here. I am not even good at writing, why don’t I just keep my thoughts to myself. But I am keeping them to myself, its not like anyone will ever read this, why would they. I am alone with only some empty beer cans to keep me company.

The biggest is that my MC is aware of a terrible secret involving a powerful man, but she can't reveal it to anyone without them mysteriously dying soon after.

My question is whether the romantic plot is doomed by her keeping the secret from her partner, even if it's for his own protection? The secret is never revealed to her partner during the book, so there's no resolution there.

The WIP is conceived as a romance novella that exists between two parts of a planned suspense trilogy, but I want its feel and structure to remain very different from the series (hence the romance, a genre I am unfamiliar with and don't intend to read). I'm not trying to market it to the romance genre necessarily, but I also don't want to make a romance reader feel cheated by the lack of resolution to her dishonesty.

I'm really struggling with structuring a POV issue and wondered if you could offer your advice. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. 

So, without going into the premise too much; chapter 1 opens up in the 3rd Person Omniscient. A group of researchers come to interview my protagonist. My initial aim was to then follow on in 1st person until the final chapter which would then return to third-person omniscient. 

The problem then arises as to how to work with other characters. You see, the protagonist is not the only person being interviewed. Unbeknownst to her, her sister is also being interviewed, so we end up with a split storyline with a split timeline and a double 1st person account and two singular chapters in the third person. Complicated. 

I worry about confusing the reader. The thing is that the plot is so rich that I can't really explore it properly without taking it from a two-person POV, and I tried looking at it entirely within 3rd person omniscient, but it's just not working. 

Atwood just about managed a complicated POV story in the Testaments (a debatable assertion IMO). That might provide a model but I wondered if you guys had any ideas?"

There was a pretty villainous ""good guy"" and a bad guy who was getting revenge for his species but who had his perspective written so well that I actually agreed with him, also most of the things he does is just trying to go back in time to be with the love of his life, I feel you man.

So now I'm confused. Where is the line between justified revenge and villainy? Or is the idea of needing revenge considered villainous in itself? 

For example, in another book I was reading, a girl who was badly mistreated by everyone in her village grew up and got herself turned into a vampire. She then took out her revenge by murdering those who had wronged her. Villain--for murdering all those people.

But.

She only touched the people who had personally hurt her, forced themselves onto her, and nearly killed her back when she was weaker. So now that she is stronger, it makes sense to me that she would go back and exact revenge for what they did to her. (Maybe that would make me the villain in a story. Idk.)

Many protagonists I have read also have stories along this line. Taken advantage because of their weakness, grew up stronger, exacted revenge, or we call it justice when it's heroes.

So where is the line? What is the difference between a hero and a villain in the regards of avenging and getting revenge? 

(Sorry if this is a kind of stupid question) All help appreciated, thank you in advance."

How to get over this roadblock? I've been letting this broad idea for a fantasy setting simmer in my mind for many months, and I think I have a bunch of really interesting ideas to potentially play with. However, for the life of me, I can't think of an over-arching plot to make something better than the sum of its parts.

Setting ideas include things like:
- A culture that resembles 11-century Europe full of superhuman knights that slay monsters and go on dangerous quests, but struggle with the expectations of nobility and its obligations
- An empire that resembles Sassanian Persia, with its own heavily developed chivalric martial ethos, a rich tradition of art and poetry and courtly love, and a hell-bent desire to destroy a Byzantine-counterpart rival nation and reclaim old territories
- An afterlife in which a departed soul returns to a collective cosmic essence, which in turn spins off fragments for creation of new lives; this essence is affected by the lives that the souls have lived, and serves as the stage for the greater cosmic battle between good and evil
- A China-like region that was destroyed at some point in the past by some magical disaster, leaving everyone who was killed unable to pass on to the afterlife and basically turning that part of the world into Mordor
   - Refugees from that disaster being cursed with functional immortality, infertility, and magical super-PTSD
- A divine revelation having been given to all of humanity in pre-literate times, leading to different religions due to cultural drift, but with an underlying sense of universality to it

And I have the beginning of an idea for a character arc, following a knight from the not-European culture who is more bookish and artistic than martial, and gets captured in battle by a not-Persian knight. From there, he really takes to his captors' culture and has a plot that kind of looks like *The Last Samurai*.

But besides all that, I can't think of an idea for a more macro-level story that might tie those things together (or at least explore all of them) and provide a through-line. And so I'm stuck wondering what might be the point of that character arc without something bigger playing out in the background.

An innocent and playful DC fanfiction.

How do I know when to... not settle but to stick to it? When do I need to dig my heels in and see the potential in that one special story while not falling for the temptation of another?

Overheard one today that's spiraled into about a dozen different story idea's- I was shopping for some jeans and a few rows over a couple women (one with a child), in the maternity section, were chatting when I overheard the kid very excitedly say ""Oh, oh, is that the baby kicking?""

The woman said very clearly ""Actually, I just had a little girl about your age for lunch. Watch out, I might have room for seconds!"" The little girl squealed and both woman laughed, and there I am off in the corner with that little voice in my head saying 'well, what if she'd not kidding?'

Chapter 1 
""God, Aiden, is this just me, or do these taste like kindergarten? Not like paste- which I definitely did not eat- but just the good parts."" I wave my rainbow Ukrop cookie in the air, a few precious crumbs flying towards his purposefully messy cocoa hair.
We're sitting in his bedroom, eating cookies and singing while we take turns taking pictures using my old camera.
Aiden shakes his head, grinning at me and showing off his crooked canine tooth. He's tall, his lanky legs hanging off the edge of his twin bed. His undercut is crafted so meticulously, it looks like a piece of art. His umber colored eyes meander around the room, landing on his quacking phone. He grabs another one of my cookies and reads the text, his warm brown skin glowing red to match his baggy Nantucket sweatshirt, from the summer our families spent in Massachusetts.
Aiden quickly types out a reply and he returns his attention to me, preparing his comeback. 
""Ok, so you definitely were the kid in the corner eating paste. It's the only reasonable explanation to why you are who you are."" I playfully smack him in the shoulder before finishing off my cookie. 
""So, who are you texting, lover boy?” I’m grinning, but when I turn and stare into his eyes, I see the pain in them. 
“Shit. Ai, what’s wrong?” 
“Nothing,” he says, his voice insistent. I don’t buy it- his shoulders are slumped and his eyes have more bags under them than normal.
He's doing it now, mashing his face into the misshapen pillow. ""Ai- Spill,"" I say, my voice tired and worn from my own day at home, but I push some resenting love into it. 
Aiden sucks in a huge breath. ""You haven't... you haven't told anyone what I said that day, right? I mean, the day I came out. Like, any of it?"" He's still chewing on his knuckles, but he's turned his body to face the ceiling now. 
""No!"" I say a little too forcefully and he startles. ""I mean- God, no.""
He nods, looking shameful. ""Yeah. Of course not.""
Aiden tries to return to his cavern of blankets, but I grab his wrist and yank him over onto my lap. ""Spill. What's up? Why would you think I'd out you?""
""No... no reason. Just... you know, checking.""
""You are one crappy liar, Ai. Please. Tell me what’s up. Or I’ll have to use other methods,” I finish, cocking my head. His head burrows farther into my shoulder, and I squeeze his arm. 
He sighs. 
“Ok, look. There was- I’ve had at least three people who’ve told me I need to meet Joshua Green. In, like, a day.” I sigh, letting the knives that clench in my stomach dig a little deeper. 
Joshua Green is the only openly gay kid in our grade.
I stare at Aiden’s numb eyes.

“Look at me.” His eyes float away. “Look at me, Ai. I love you- no matter what happens with these idiots. I love you, and it always gets better. It always gets better, and you know that. We get the hell out of this town, and it gets so much better. Two years until we graduate. No regrets,” I say. It’s our motto.
Aiden nods, but from the way he bites his lip and the way his eyes struggle to look at mine, I can tell he doesn’t believe me. 
“No regrets,” he says. 
I hug him, wishing that if I held him long enough, I could squeeze all the pain out of him. But I know from personal experience that pain and bad memories linger as if the past had a bad aftertaste. 
Every sharp word stays.
Every snide look remains.
Every possible bad memory decides to stick around, bugging you. 
I should know- my brain is a collection of moments and words I wish I could forget. 

Aiden slowly pulls away, slinking over to my camera and picking it up gingerly. 
I hear him click through the photos- pictures of him with indie filters or in black and white. Eating ice cream. Goofily grinning. A few he doesn’t know I took, where his cheeks shine with tears and his body is crumpled. One of me where Aiden’s stolen my camera; I have dark lines under my eyes but a passionate smile and a cock-eyed bob. 
“I love this one,” he quietly says, breaking the silence. I slowly get up and wander over to him.  He holds it out to me, and smiles sadly, reminiscing of when things weren’t so complicated. When my house wasn’t a war zone and he wasn’t a casualty of the battles at school.
 It’s a picture from a few months ago. We’re on the handrail of the Memorial Bridge, sitting perched on the thin ledge, grinning. Aiden still has his braces, and they shimmer in the evening sun. My messily cut hair is the shade of a raindrop, matching the sky. The river is swift and wild in the background, but we aren’t in the least bit scared. I got one of the many walkers to take the picture, so the image is a little shaky, but it’s still easily one of the best. 

“Yeah,” I say, exhaling. “Know what- let’s go.”  Aiden stares at me like I’m crazy. 
“What?” He asks like he must’ve heard me wrong.
“Let’s go,” I repeat. “Let’s go to the river. C’mon. You have your license, right?” 
He nods. “Yeah, but you and I both know my mom would kill me, and her permission supersedes-” 
“The state of Michigan,” I finish. “Yeah, yeah, I know. I’ll get Marcus drive. He’s an adult, technically, and he owes me.”
Aiden shrugs, which I read as an enthusiastic yes, 
I shoot him a quick text and grin at Aiden, triumphant. 

I skip down the stairs, my dress swirling around my knees. It’s white with small flowers embroidered on it, something I rescued from the thrift shop a few months ago and have worn religiously since then. 

I’m leaning against the car, examining our house as I wait for Marcus to come outside. I ran through the neighborhood to our house, leaving Aiden about a minute behind me. 
A perfectly manicured Colonial-era house, with bright green grass and flowering beds. Three stories, all painted a clean white. Black clapboards. Flower boxes on the windows. Our house looks impeccable, and that’s the idea. That we can cover up the shouting and anger with a fresh coat of paint and some well-organized flowers. 

Marcus walks out the door, his eyes bloodshot. He’s thrown on a pair of jeans and a shirt for the local hockey team that he plays on. He hasn’t shaved in a while, and his face is covered in scraggly hazel hairs. He seems entranced with something on his phone, before sticking it in his pocket. 
“Don’t give me that look, Em. I’m fine,” he says as if he read my mind, hopping up. 
“Hey, Aiden.” Aiden waves from the driver’s seat and Marcus ducks into the back. 
“What are you listening to?” He asks, teasing.
 I glance back at him. I know this routine, and it worries me. He’s doing the one where he pretends he’s happy, teases us for a bit, but something is going on. 
I lift an eyebrow, but he continues. 
“Does this car have an aux or something?” Marcus asks. 
I shake my head. “No. Kingsley doesn’t have one of those. He’s pretty old.” 
Marcus playfully tsks and returns to whatever is on his phone, then puts it away and drives us out. 
We drive the half-hour out to the bridge, listening to only Prince and Madonna. The parking lot is crowded for an evening, and the sun has begun to dip low into the buildings, making the silhouettes glimmer shades of red and yellow.  
We hop out of the sedan and Marcus stays inside, spreading out in the backseat and shutting his eyes. 
“You sure you’re ok?” I cautiously ask. “You can come with us if you want.”
 He smiles weakly and shakes his head. I shut the door and Aiden locks the car. We walk across the high bridge to a spot in the middle and stop. My mind is a flurry of worries, between Aiden and Marcus. I sigh and reach for the camera in my bag.
I haven’t ever taken a good photo, but it’s a fun hobby and I like focusing on specific things. Marcus got me the camera for my birthday a few years ago. 

I turn around to find Aiden talking with a tall boy who seems about our age, and two little girls. His blond hair looks like the color of fall leaves in the setting sun, and his cheeks are flushed despite the cool breeze. The girls have the same bleached blond hair but shoulder length instead. One has on messy overalls, covered in paint, while the other wears a green a line dress with a rust colored cardigan, despite the seasonable March chill. I mean, it’s Michigan. There’s no reason you should wear a dress in March, let alone in our small town where winter’s hand still holds our town tightly. I wander over to them, reaching down to scratch the dog’s head. 
Aiden introduces me. 
“This is Nash, and his two little sisters, Jamie and Lacy.”
 The latter is the one covered in paint. She smiles and sticks out a hand. I shake it, surprised by her grip. Jamie waves shyly and I return the gesture. I turn to face Nash and begin to examine him. Freckles cover his cheeks, and acne his nose. He looks nice but closed off. 
“It’s nice to meet you,” I say, smiling. “Your dog’s really cute.” 
The girls nod proudly and Nash begins to warm up. 
“He’s a mix of a poodle and a Bernese mountain dog. His name’s Bernie.” 
I scratch his head again, and Bernie’s tail wags. “Hi, Bernie,” I coo. He barks happily as I pet him. Aiden continues chatting with Nash about school and movies and I wander over to my camera, beckoning for the girls to come with me. They cautiously follow me a few feet away from the boy, where I hold my camera, an eager look in my eyes. 
“Would you guys mind if I took a picture of you?” I ask tentatively. I normally don’t talk to strangers about this kind of thing, but I’m craving some kind of photography. They nod. 
“So, what grade are you guys in? Seventh? Sixth?” I ask, trying to make small talk while I set up the camera. 
“Sixth,” Lacy confirms. I nod.
 “Yeah. Do you guys like middle school? I mean, I don’t have the best memories, but that might be just me.”
 I continue moving the girls around, trying to get them feeling comfortable and more natural. “Um, I guess. It’s not great,” Jamie says, seeming uncertain. I nod. The two are so stiff, they might as well be statues. It’ll turn out worse than normal if they stay this uncomfortable. I love taking candid portraits. 
“Hmm. Why don’t you guys just play with the dog and stuff?”
 I suggest, and Lacy and Jamie quickly scoot over to Bernie and start playing with him.
Immediately, Jamie begins to smile, and her unfairly amber eyes shimmer, while Lacy’s dimples pop out. Snapping half a dozen pictures, I show them to the girls, who make me promise to somehow send them copies. I nod and return to Aiden and Nash, who’re laughing so hard that Aiden’s face is crimson, and Nash is shaking. I nudge Aiden. 
“Hey. It’s been like forty-five minutes. Marcus is impatient AF, and it’s getting dark,” I point out and he sadly waves goodbye to Nash, promising to send him my pictures. 

We jog back to Aiden’s car, unlocking the doors. Marcus startles, picking himself up from the seat. His eyes a
re rimmed with red, but I don’t point it out. Instead, I nudge him over impatiently and grab the remaining Cheez-it’s from the bag he pillaged. That bag had been in the car for at least six months, so they’re stale and drier than usual. 
“How was your nap?” I ask, and he shrugs. 
Aiden opens the door, a foolish grin still painted on his face. 
“Why is he so happy?” Marcus asks, pointing his head towards Aiden. 
“I have no idea,” I respond, shrugging. “We just met this kid Nash and hi- ohmigod. You have a crush on Nash!” I exclaim and Aiden looks around blushing while Marcus stares at me, confused.
“I do not. He’s just a friend, and definitely straight,” Aiden says, his cheeks burning even brighter. He’s more flustered than usual. 
“No? He’s cute. He seemed like he liked you…” I trail off, smirking. He totally has a crush.  
He shakes his head, the smile fading. He sticks the key into the ignition and we drive home in silence. 



Chapter 2

We dropped Aiden of hours ago, and the ticking time bomb that had been counting off in the back of my head all day has finally blown. 
An owl hoots, breaking my quiet into shards. I sigh, pulling out my airpods. I stick them in and chose my favorite playlist- a mix of everything good. I turn the volume up all the way until the drums are screaming and I can’t hear anything but the sound of a guitar. 
It starts out with the angry part. Machine Gun Kelly, Eminem, The Kid Laroi. I get so into the music, the switch shocks me. “The Whole of the Moon,” one of my favorite songs, plays next, starting out my oldies section. 

The next song comes and goes, along with the next after that. The music is cranked so loud I can’t hear anything, which is why I don’t notice Marcus when he cracks open the window and hops beside me.
“GOD!” I shriek, my voice at a whisper. “What is wrong with you?!” He’s startled me, and I’m still closed off as I scooch over to make room for his spindly body. 
He doesn’t answer the question and I worry I’ve hit a nerve that I try to avoid. 

I didn’t think anyone knew I was up here. I guess I like that- the idea that I had one place all to myself. No Marcus. No Aiden. No one except me, at least for a while. 
“Look- what’s up?” I say. I’m tired of this bullshit. 
His eyes roam around, not landing anywhere near me.  He plays with his curly hair and finally looks me in the eyes. He looks worse than earlier. His mouth twists into a shy, nervous line, and he inhales. 
“I just, uh, I wanted to apologize. You got dealt a shitty hand because of me, and it really sucks. I know mom and dad suck, but I made it worse than it could’ve been for you if I wasn’t here, and I’m really sorry for that. 
I blink. I wasn’t expecting an apology, but I appreciate it.
“I mean, it’s not your-,” I start to say, but he shakes his head.
“It’s not, Em. If I wasn’t here, if I was the kid who mom and dad wanted me to be, you wouldn’t have to deal with their bull. And for that, I’m really, really sorry.”

I bite my lip and scan his face. 
“Hey. Marcus. It’s not ok, you’re right, but if you were one of those pretentious douchebags our parents wish you were, then you wouldn’t be Marcus, and I need you to be Marcus. And I’d be the only family disappointment, and what fun would that be.”
He blinks and nods like he doesn’t believe me. 
“Em,” he says, at last, his voice almost silent. “I’m still sorry, though.” 
Marcus nods with an air of finality and moves to slip out the window and back into the warzone of a house, where he’s stuck choosing to go back to his dorm at the local college or sneaking out to see a friend. 
I hesitate. 
“Marcus.” He turns around. “Wanna stay up here a little longer?” I ask, nervous. He considers it for a moment. 
“Yeah, I guess so,” he finally says, his voice sharp as glass and gentle as a breeze all at the same time.

We sit perched on the edge of our roof for a while until our eyelids become heavy and the sun begins to peek out from behind clouds. 

I wake up to a gray sky and pink clouds. Crap. I look over at Marcus, who’s sprawled on his back. I look him over, trying to get a read on him. I glance towards his arms, but before I can make sure everything’s ok, he sits up quickly, somehow sensing my gaze and pulling his body into a concealed tuck. Marcus groans, cracking his neck and stretching out. I glance at my phone, yawning. Ugh.. It’s almost ten already- thank God for weekends. I have eighty-six missed texts from Aiden, and twelve missed calls. Motioning for Marcus to go in front of me, I step back into my bedroom and dial Aiden. He picks up on the first ring, sounding eager and full of caffeine. 
“What the hell is so important that you text me eighty-six times in the span of like two hours?” I ask, exasperated. I hear him breathing over the phone, sounding like he’s just been running.
“We texted for an hour last night!” He excitedly proclaims, and because my brain refuses to function before noon, I have no idea who the enigmatic “he” is. 
“Nash,” Aiden says, still breathless and giddy.
“Ahh.” I smile, sitting down, taking a sip of my day-old coffee, and grimacing. 
“Soo,” I pry. Aiden is silent for a moment, then finally speaks. 
“What do you think about going to the farmers’ market?”

I look through my closet, trying to find the right thing that says both, “I’m so excited that you and Aiden have romantic prospects” and “Hurt my best friend and I will cause you to feel unimaginable pain.” I finally settle on an oversized sweatshirt for the Magic Marlins, our local hockey team, and a plaid mini skirt with thick wool leggings underneath and my Air Force Ones. 

The house is empty aside from Marcus and our ancient orange tabby cat, Marmalade. 
I hop out the door, knowing my parents won’t notice the lack of my appearance at breakfast, but I scribble out an illegible note anyway. 
Aiden is waiting for me impatiently, Kingsley’s engine humming. I slide into the front seat, beckoning for Marcus to come with us. He reluctantly sits down in the driver's seat, ruffling his messy hair. 
“Why exactly am I sitting in your car unreasonably named Kingsley at 10:23 in the morning?” He asks, poking Aiden in the forehead and glancing at me. 
Aiden is practically a brother to the both of us- the only family problem he has is that he’s an only child, so Marcus decided to adopt him, and since then, has been his older brother, dedicated to making fun of him just enough to show his love.
“That is a good question,” he responds vaguely. “And for the record- Kingsley is a wonderful name for a car. No more questions until we get there.” And with an air of finality, Marcus backs out of our driveway and begins our journey.  

We pull out of our neighborhood, driving past matching houses covered in shades of grey paint and winding ivy. Mr. Davis waves from his driveway, where he stands in a velour tracksuit to rival George Costanza’s, his dirt-brown toupee blowing in the wind. 
We continue down the winding streets and past houses that scream “I have trust-fund kids,” which I can’t be too obnoxious about because I’m one of those trust-fund kids. 
Aiden, not so much. He has a house that seems more like a home and less like it’s just walls and useless rooms that echo a bit too well. But he doesn’t have a guaranteed ride to college without student loans, doesn’t have a vacation out of the country every year.
The highway is crowded, busy with people heading to their Saturday jobs. We drive past the “get a little Lippo” billboard and the abandoned warehouse stretch of the highway before turning into a park tucked away behind buildings. 
A worn iron sign with ornate lettering reads “Birchwood Park” and two ancient-looking fences lead winding road downhills and past wide soccer fields.
Marcus jerks through the entrance and after being raised with two aggressive drivers, I instinctively squeeze the handles. 
“Good lord,” I say. “How did you pass that test?” Marcus gives me a dry laugh, focusing on the grandma in front of us, who has decided to drive 15 in a 25-zone. “Hardy-har-har. You should go on tour, Em.” 
I stick out my tongue at him and turn down the radio.
 “So why are we even here?” I ask, wondering why he had us wait until we got here to explain. 

Aiden has a sudden fascination with the road, avoiding meeting my eyes. “Aiiiideeennn?” I draw out his name, Marcus gives him the look only an older brother can give, filled with love, irritation, and exasperation. He turns into a small parking lot jammed with other cars and begins to navigate Kingsley around, searching for a rare spot. Marcus drums his fingers on the wheel, waiting for an old hatchback to pull out.
I stare at him. Aiden plays with his keychain, avoiding eye contact. I sigh.
“Aiden. Please tell me you didn’t stalk Nash and end up here?” Marcus meanders around the parking lot, landing on an empty spot, which he aggressively pulls into. “Oh, god. Aiden,” I start, but before I can finish, Marcus unclips his seatbelt and with one smooth movement, he grabs his phone, opens the door, and manages to find a stick of gum. “I’m gonna go pick some flowers,” he nonchalantly says, like all nineteen-year-olds spend their time making daisy chains. 
I watch him wander over to a field and plop down. I hope he’s not high.
I made it clear to him when we were younger, after the first time I caught him smoking a blunt. I needed him to be 100% there. I couldn’t survive my parents without him, and I needed to make sure he was ok. 
Aiden and I walk through the crowd full of college students in trendy clothing. A cobblestone path leads past dozens of stands- honey, pies, macrame hangers, hats, fish, coffee- and winds around, then ends with food trucks and carts.
Aiden begins talking as we stand in line at a breakfast sandwich stand.
“So I sent him the pictures you took yesterday- the ones of the girls.” I nod, following so far. “And we were talking, and he asked if you’d take his picture. And- I said yeah. So we’re meeting him on his break.” 
“I’m sorry- I must have heard you wrong. I thought you said you volunteered me to take the picture of some random boy I don’t know,” I say through gritted teeth. “I don’t even have my camera.” There. He can’t make me take someone’s picture if I don’t have my camera.
It’s not that I don’t want to photograph Nash- he’d be a great model. Wispy blonde hair that falls in his eyes, flushed cheeks, dimples, and a splattering of freckles. Lean body, somewhat muscular. Decent style- khakis and plain t-shirts that fit snugly on his fit body.
It’s just- pictures are sacred and real. Staged ones come out the worst, and while Nash was nice, he wasn’t real. For a picture to be accurate, you have to let your guard down, and it isn’t my job to find out how to get him to that point. 
“Two egg-sausage-and-cheese biscuits, please.” Aiden grabs the tinfoil-wrapped food and pays the woman. She’s got this big, wavy brown hair, tied back in a bandana, and a wide smile on her face. We continue walking. Aiden attempts to pull something out of my bag, grinning, but I peek in myself. 
“You have got to be kidding me.” Inside, I see my usual things- wallet, phone, notebook, bandaids, Tylenol, headphones, tampons, a mini water bottle, and a granola bar- but I also see my Nikon-600. 
“You. Are unbelievable,” I murmur, looking at Aiden, but I’m smiling. I know he likes Nash, and I know that I’m stuck being the way he gets to at least figure out if Nash likes him back.. 

Aiden looks at me with his irritatingly pleading eyes and I sigh. 
“Where does he work?”
Aiden grins, his tired face spreading wide. “Really?”
I nod. Aiden is normally peppy, but today he has the energy of a labrador retriever. “Follow me.”
I trail behind him, glancing at the different people tucked between woods. 
We stop at a flower tent, where bouquets of lavender, sunflowers, azaleas, daisies, and other fresh flowers lie. I step up to the line, where I pull out my wallet. Twelve dollars for a bouquet. Nash turns around from the previous customer and smiles when he sees us. 
“Hey, guys,” he starts. “Let me finish with this sweet young lady-” The elderly lady holding roses grins- “and I’ll take my break.” He returns his attention to ringing up her and with a charming grin, sweeps the flowers into her bag.
“See you next week, Mrs. Cortez.” 
I stop him before he pulls off the apron reading “Brandon Flowers.”
“Actually,” I begin, “I need some sunflowers.” Aiden happily looks at me, his eyes full of thanks. 
I wink at him as we follow Nash out to a fallen log, covered in vines and dirt. He has my flowers in his arms, while I hold my camera. 
“Go sit there. Aiden- you talk to him, get him pliable.” I command. Nash chuckles. “I’m not art supplies, you know,” he points out, and I hush him. The two boys sit on the log, stiffly at first, but as Aiden talks, Nash’s body loosens up. 

I study the clouds as Aiden’s soothing voice runs through the wind and I catch him grinning in the corner of my eye. I return the enthusiastic smile, sighing and brushing my bangs out of my eyes. They need a trimming- the frosty blue tangles have started reaching past my brows and covering my eyes. This isn’t exactly a big issue, because my silver eyes aren’t too interesting to look at, but recently, it’s been getting annoying. I shake my head, letting the loose waves fall around my chin. I turn back to the boys, whose smiles are warm and open now. 
But the thing with looking at people through a lens is that you can see them, truly. And sometimes the things I see are hard. I haven’t taken Marcus’s picture for a long time. 

Aiden’s grin holds up as he steps away from the log, slowly, but Nash beckons for him to come back. At that, Aiden looks ecstatic, like a kid in a candy store. They sit loosely on the log. Nash’s dimples shine in the early spring sunlight, and Aiden’s light brown skin takes on an aura of gold. I have him hold the flowers, tucking a sunflower behind Nash’s ear. He chuckles softly, and I yank out my camera, which I had stowed in my bag while setting up. 
“Y’all just act natural,” I command, knowing how hard that is. “Talk a little, and just smile when I say so.” They nod and begin discussing Patriot Games, which Aiden made me watch in seventh grade, and which I immediately hated. 
I try to capture the pureness in Aiden. The way his head tilts and his lips purse. 
Nash is a little harder to try and figure out. His smile is natural but seems like it's covering up something.  I zoom in and out, trying to figure out which angle looks best. I finally land on a spot in the grass, where I lie with the camera pointed upwards, catching the boys by surprise. I take a few shots without their knowledge, knowing they’ll turn out the best. Finally, I bellow “smile” and they flash pearly white teeth simultaneously. Happy with my work, I brush the dry grass off my leggings, proudly holding up the camera and motioning for Nash to come to see my brilliance. 
The woods are blurred out in the background, a smattering of greens and browns. The log the boys perch on looks to be an inviting cocoa, matching Aiden’s complexion. Nash is tan and warm, his messy blonde hair making the sunflower tucked beside it pop even more. The one I’m showing off is something I took when they were caught unsuspecting, and I notice something I didn’t realize before.
Nash is staring mesmerized not at me like he’s supposed to, but at Aiden- specifically, Aiden’s lips. Blushing a warm red. I turn to him, speechless. He stutters and turns, making his escape quickly."

Usually the absurdity of the conclusion isn't actually absurd at all, thought the steps that lead to it are themselves absurd.

It's also not a form of jumping to conclusions, or at least not a pure one, because the way the conclusion is framed is perfectly consistent with the reasons for it.

Just a made up example:

*""I accidentally fell through a doorway in an abandoned house and wound up in another world. Your world. There's abandoned houses with doorways for me to fall through here. But they don't work! I think I need* someone *in order to make it accidental. You know, surprise me. Could that someone be you?""*

*""I just remembered"" said the half-elf half-werewolf who wore the skull of a goblin, as they backed away slowly, ""I think I have an appointment with my optometrist.""*

He got transferred to another world by accidentally falling through a doorway in an abandoned house. That's already absurd, there's no logical connection there, but whyever it happened he believes he needs to repeat the process to get home: a very reasonable assumption. But he's tried finding abandoned houses and falling through their doorways, and he hasn't gotten back home yet. The assumption is still valid but something is wrong. He's not recreating the events perfectly enough, maybe. The missing element is of course the 'accidental' part. Another reasonable assumption. Therefore, he must accidentally fall through the doorway. But you can't intentionally do something accidentally, so someone else must do it when he's not expecting it. A reasonable conclusion despite the absurdity of the concepts involved.

Is there a name for this sort of thing?"

The thing is that I want to write my despair in form of feelings, but I don't know which genre, type or form of writing down someone's own feelings is the most impactful on the reader, basically I want to release everything out of me and successfully carry it over to the paper through epic quotes and a heavy usage of stylistic devices. Although I am not a musician/composer writing a song is an example of a good way of carrying over your feelings to the reader/listener, and that is the impact I want to achieve with my writings, like a song can hit you like a hammer, I want my written painting to glow my feelings out.

It SHOULD be laid back overall, but I'd like to offer something for those kids who are ready to just get started with actually writing and workshopping.

What are some ideas for 30-50-minute creative writing exercises I could implement for part of the group?"

2893,HistoryLord, ,4,writing,1630248270,"How to write a good novel-length Resistance/insurgency story I am a fan of stories about rebels fighting a totalitarian government, from Star Wars to the Hunger Games. Something about them just appeals to me on a personal level, so I have decided that my first novel is going to be about that subject, within the context of a fantasy world in which a genocide is taking place against talking animals, with themes of family, friendship and religion present in the story.  I've been putting the basic ideas for this story together for about two years and I want to make something good out of it.   


The problem is, I don't know how to make this kind of story interesting enough for a novel. Some of the stories I've seen just involve the characters blowing things up and assassinating people left and right, but I don't want my story to be so boring.  I want to explore the aforementioned themes as well, but I don't want to create a boring story out of those either.   


I want there to be discussions about religion, since religion is one of the driving factors for the genocide and the resulting resistance, but I don't want the novel to turn into a manifesto about the evils of religion, which would inevitably drive the narrative to a halt.   


I want to explore the relationships between the characters, but I don't want to turn the story into a soliloquy about the characters' feelings, which could turn off some readers. There are two characters in the story who are quite close (a mother-son type relationship) by the time of the beginning of the story.   


Basically, I want to make a story that is interesting and addresses aspects that I deem important, but I want to address those aspects in a way that moves the narrative forward and is not repeated endlessly  to the irritation of the reader.    


Also, part of me wants to potentially turn this into a series, but I obviously have to get this story done before I begin to think about that."

MC had a traumatic childhood, turned to drugs and partying as a coping mechanism, and often sleeps around. One of the main plots is his coworker accidentally outing him as gay to all of their coworkers. He struggles with feeling like he doesn't truly belong with any group of people, because his straight friends don't understand how big of a deal it was for him to be forced to come out, and his gay friends constantly pick on him for ""not acting gay enough"". This character means so much to me because I have poured so much time and effort into writing him, and a lot of his experiences/feelings mirror my own. But as I see other gay characters and read LGBTQ stories, I feel like I'm just writing something that has been done a million times.

There's been this trend of whenever you don't need a character anymore - kill them! Want to redeem the bad guy? Kill them! Want to spice your story? KILL SOME BITCHES

honestly I'm tired of how normalized this shit is. People think that death = depth and that for me is Just false. Randomly killing your characters at the end because you don't know what to do with them is such a lazy way out.

Some of the most emotionally impactful stories I've read weren't filled with gore/murder just because they could, and when a character did die It was for a reason, It was important.

I've fallen into this pithole myself and not only does It make your story dull and """"""""edgy"""""""" It pulls the readers out. Writes need to start understanding tone. I'll be honest and say I do like me some murder - But for the love of God don't Just use It for """"'character developmet"""""" or Just because you can. Consider the story you're writing.

There will be in the second one (I think). The tone of the book is Dystopian but the more specific elements are based around overpopulation and lack of contraceptives' so I feel at some point (especially with my two main characters) there is going to be some sexy stuff.

So I have read great books, such as Poison Study by Maria V. Snyder that do a very good job of letting the two main characters get together in a meaningful way, but they don't talk about the actual deed. 

I have also read Outlander by Diana Gabaldon which is pretty raunchy at times but it fits because Jamie and Claire seem to need each other in a certain way. 

So I was speaking with my husband on the subject. He said that he is often disappointed when you have a really good story that gets too intimate and takes away from the plot of the story. I agree with him, but I am also worried that in a story where the two main characters are meant to be, my readers might be disappointed if there is no detailed sex scene. 

So what is your opinion on sex scenes in books - does it distract from the story or does it breathe life into it?"

”it was a nightmare, it’s alright” said Sean sighing, while he tried to wipe away the sweat from her forehead. Her hair were almost attached to her forehead due to the sweat.

”you have high fever and probably had a nightmare”

”I wish I could go back to my parents. I wish they would take me with them. I saw my father in the dream and was so happy because I thought I was going to be with them again” her eyes filled with tears “I thought it was finally over and I would see them again. but no, I am still here. Why?” She wondered while tears streamed down her face. she checked her wound and it was still hurting. “I wonder why the bullet didn’t catch me right. Why?“

“dont say such things, it’s a sin. Ona, how can you say such things? Your parents wouldn’t want that for you” Sean was angry and sad at the same time and due to the tiredness he almost started crying, as his eyes turned red. But he held the tears back.

”you don’t understand… you don’t understand anything” said Ona, crying again.

”I am so tired of living, the bullet could have spared me a life I’m tired living, why am I still here? I hate this life. I hate everyone and everyone around me, nobody loves me or treats me like a human, I just can’t keep living like this, I want my parents back”

”Ona… no… you shouldnt think such things” Sean said, while checking her temperature with his hand, and went to take a wet cloth to put on her forehead.

”you have high fever, that’s why you’re saying these things” “here, put this on your forehead And take this” said Sean while handing her the wet cloth and the medicine.

”I always thought this. I’m tired of life, Sean. You don’t understand how much a person can bear”.

”All I know is that your parents would want to see you happy and fulfilling your dreams” Sean said while a tear streamed down his cheek. He hoped she hadnt noticed.

”I can’t. And I am tired of my own life. I dream of them every night Sean. I want to go back to them, though they tell me not to come. But I don’t have no one in my life Sean, I’m alone” she sobbed again. His heart ached seeing her like that.

he put again his hand on her forehead and then touched her cheek. Ona blushed and was scared.

”No… don’t say that, you have me. I will always be there for you, I promise you I will protect you and take care of you” he said, while looking into her eyes in the dimlight.

But Ona took away his hand. “I don’t want your help. You can help those pretty middle class girls, so That you can become the son in law of someone important and inherit everything and have a nice life. With them, you wouldn’t be as fake and forced like you are with me. I am annoying and you always tell me I am a little girl who doesn’t understand. Sean,  I don’t need or want your help. All I need is something I can’t have in this world. you should have let me die, that would have been better”.

Sean hardly kept his tears. He didn’t want to look weak in front of her.

”Ona, no… don’t say these things, you’re young, I know it’s hard, but I promise it will get better. I am here with you. Look, I won’t move from here. I will sleep here on the chair next to you and hold your hand the whole night, try to sleep now” he said in a calm voice, trying to hide his pain.

Ona kept crying while she turned her back to him and fell asleep due o the fever almost right away.

Sean sat on the chair next to her, and when she turned her back into his direction during the night, he held her hand and rested his head on shoulders on her bed, while having the rest of his body on he chair.

The world known as echoes is a dangerous and strange place holding all sorts of alien fauna and flora. Stranger warping sun space cause things from earth to land here. Eventually many early humans were transported here and forced to contend with a world not made for them. With luck they managed to survive for several eras. In present times humans have built society but  still discover many new things in the world the reside in

In echoes a strange structure exist known as the neo-forge. It appears as a floating carved crystal like structure with no entrance In early times attempts to enter it always failed. a large group of humans managed to somehow enter it but never returned. However it began to produce altered infants that came out like the forge teleported them from inside it. These are known as children of the forge (if you have a better name I encourage you to share it)

The children were appreciated as their abilities gave them an edge in surviving the dangerous landscape of echoes. All children from the forge have incredible powers relating to manipulating the world. This can go from simple fire manipulation to controlling gravity or atomic structures. When using their powers a signature color will grow on them along with strange patterns similar to the ones on the forge. Many possess different physical features to go with their powers. Some are shown with gills and scales while some have different colored skin and eyes. Common traits are strange natural hair colors such as Snow White or discolored patches of red.

All who come from the forge have a bracelet around their wrist. It is a simple metal band with a faint pattern around it. It can never come off the person. Aside from being indestructible and self-repairing even if you manage to remove it will hunt you down to once again be placed on you. The bracelet reacts when powers are being used such as extending in size or taking on different designs. It is theorized the bracelets are the forges way of identifying people made from it."

The actions are the establishments of those thoughts. The problem we all face is one of these two, or both of you are particularly unfortunate. The doubt. The doubt that lies within the thoughts. Or the hesitation. The hesitation that lies within the establishment of those thoughts, a sister of doubt if you would. 

A death does lie within both, but are you alive if you shan't experience either one on occasion? The funny thing is really that they both take effort and thinking in order to enact themselves, the doubt and the hesitation both.

 So are you in a way, killing yourself? I guess in a way we are all an endless phoenix, rising from the ashes of our own dead thoughts, with hopes that we are in every way better than what we were before."

If you're 10 chapters in, or more, and decide that a new plot line needs to be added should you stop and rewrite the entire story or should you keep writing as if the changes happened?

If you keep writing, pretending the changes are already added, how do you do it without messing up the story and confusing yourself?  Wouldn't you have to guess everyone's relationships at that point since you didn't build up the relationships in previous chapters? How can you meld the two halves together?

2948,jfanch42,Discussion,0,writing,1631815117,"What is the value of fantastic art?   

The idea of what makes good art is subjective. It's subjective to even say what good art is. But I feel that there is a critical consensus that had formed around what constitutes good art and it's not one I agree with.

The idea is that ""mature"" or ""realistic"" art is mundane. I first had this thought when I was reading an analysis of the game *Firewatch*. It got a lot of criticism and praise when it came out. I don't really have any comment on it, but the interesting thing to me is the defense that those that really liked the game made. They claimed that the game was more mundane and thus more mature than what the detractors expected. Only people that could enjoy a more ""Adult"" game, would like it. You may or may not agree with that but the idea is fascinating to me.

The idea that to be mature you have to be dark and edgy has been pretty soundly debunked but I wonder if the writing community has replaced it with another false equivalence. Mature means mundane. Good art is about very regular people doing very regular things. It often makes a point of its characters not accomplishing their goals or even failing in a spectacular way. This sort of art likes to end in disappointment; the idea being that the ""real"" world is disappointing. But why? Anyone who has studied history knows that it's full of drama and excitement. 

There is a lot of debate about realism in writing and I feel that it is given an undue artistic primacy. Specifically, realism is juxtaposed with stylization which is called escapism. Now, this forum likes escapism.  A lot of people will defend escapism; I think we've all heard the Neil Gaiman quote. People usually phrase it like this.

""Well, it's important to read mature literature but it's fine to treat yourself with some escapism, sometimes""

From this perspective, the fantastic is like a dessert. It's not good for you but it makes you happy to have it sometimes. This attitude to me discounts the possibility for the genuine artistic merits of non-realist art.  It discounts metaphor and allegory as artistic tools. Why do we consider everything that isn’t ""realistic"" as escapism? Often the fantastic worlds that people conjure can be significantly worse than anything that happens in real life. The decayed corporate world of *Blade Runner* isn’t realistic but can it really be called escapist? What about the abstract worlds of Terry Gilliam or Wes Anderson? What about the entire genre of magical realism? Mundanity is a fine subject but why do so many treat it as the only path to true art.

So, I ask you. Why do we conflate the fantastic with the escapist? Why do we conflate the mundane with the mature and artistic?"

2950,MadmanRB, ,0,writing,1631813853,"Using a news report to set up world building, a good idea? You know setting up a new universe is harder than it looks folks, especially when your universe is set on an alien planet without human contact.

Human centric stories are easy because we have a preset of expectations.

But what if your world has no humans?

Granted, my aliens are not too alien, and I made them close to humans in everything but appearance (my aliens are humanoid rabbits, it's a science fiction series targeted at a younger audience)

Still there is a barrier of entry here, this is not Earth and my world does not share the same history or locations as Earth.

I have only a handful of things I can do here to set up my universe.

I can front load my exposition which is the easiest to do but ts a lot of exposition here!

Or... one idea I had to set up my universe was to deliver its exposition via a news report.

Since my aliens have about the same technology as we do (sans more advanced) I could just use a news report to set up my world building.

I mean, it sounds better than the typical ""character reads a book and learns history"" story setup I sometimes see.

A news report can give my audience an instant view into my universe.

I mean, this idea isn't unique, but it can serve me well methinks.

One cool mainstream product that did this well was the original 90s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, where April O'Neil gives us all the exposition we need in two minutes of film time.

Granted, that movie is still set on our planet, but man it's a good template if you want fantastic world building in a contemporary setting without the need for obligatory text crawls.

But what do you think? I have approached opening my universe from many angles now, but all seem to fall short due to my characters not being human and my story taking place on an alien world.

A news report does seem to be a nice shortcut, I can still get my information dump and front load my exposition without it coming off as jarring or boring."

“When will Mallory be discharged? She is much better now! An-”  a voice cut through those words “ She will be released in 3 days.”The lady was ecstatic  she went to go and tell Mallory immediately .When she entered she heard” Mommy!’ Lola immediately started tearing up and said “ You're leaving soon,Mallory” Mallory’s face instantly lit up. The night before she was due to leave a tempest swept through town. When Mallory woke up she was the golden rays of the sun piercing the clouds.

She put on her clothes and left the hospital where she had been kept all her life . While on the way home she spotted some flowers which she then asked about” What kind of flowers are those ,Mommy?” Lola looked at the flowers and saw they were an assortment of different ones and suggested they go and smell them. As they began smelling them Mallory asked”what is this?”Lola looked over and it was a dandelion and told Mallory to blow on it ;as she blew on it the seeds began to fly. Mallory looked in amazement  and proceeded to bombard her mother with lots of questions. She then spotted a beautiful rainbow and kept chatting to her mum about it till they got home.

They neared home and then they reached a small,cozy home Mallory stepped in and the smell of cleaning products stung her nose as she was led up the stairs she looked around at the house and when she saw her room she was ecstatic it was a small room neatly decorated with small stuff animals .Mallory was told to look around her room while her mum made breakfast. Mallory decided to play with her stuffed animals . After what seemed like a short while to her , her mom called her down to eat ,it was egg on toast.

After the meal, they headed to the market where the smell of fresh spices burned Mallory’s nose .After they had gotten away from the spices  Mallory smelled something good as she looked towards the source she saw a bakery and asked her mum about it as she pulled her sleeve . Her mom then asked her if she would like some then Mallory said  “ Yes yes yes ! it smells yummy”. As she drew close she realised that she couldn’t see the food so her mum held her so she could. As she looked at all the sweets she was grinning then she picked out a small chocolate cupcake with sprinkles because it was the same colour as lola’s hair. As she began to eat it she told her mum” Mommy,try it, it’s really nice” as Lola took a bite she was overwhelmed by it’s sweetness but she couldn’t help but think that it wasn’t as sweet as her daughter.  This whimsical, blissful time lasted only for a few weeks then...

One day, her condition worsened. You could see her life was slowly draining away. Lola was always giving her words of reassurance beside her bed like “You’ll get better soon.” or “ When you beat this let’s go to that bakery,ok? “ Mallory always responded with something like “ Yes and let's get ice cream.”  and this always included a grin .Lola would always hold back tears because she saw the life of her little girl drain away but Mallory always was optimistic. Sometime after she turned six , a tempest was going through town ,Lola was by Mallory’s side still, now she saw Mallory had turned pale she called for a nurse. Then she saw Mallory raise her hand towards the roof and say “Mommy, I can see the sun,” as she outstretched her arms she continued,”Can I have a cupcake?” Lola replied holding back tears “Yes ,of course! Mallory”. Mallory’s breaths grew slower and slower then she said weakly”I’ll touch the sun” with a subtle smile but then her hand hit the bed and all that  could be heard in that room was a long ‘beep’ and the tempest outside. Then one single cry overshadowed all the other noises “Mallory!” and then the nurses burst through the door and all they could see was a grieving mother beside her child.

Lola grew to accept the death but the pain never disappeared. There remained a hole inside her heart where Mallory used to be."

Names will be changed, some experiences will be embellished for poetic license but it will be obvious to anyone included in the story who is who. It's going to involve quite a lot of people from my past and sooner or later I think word will get back to them. 

A couple of these people are legitimately dangerous. They are comfortable with violence and the people *they* know are on an entirely different level in that regard. These facts are hardly a secret to some that know them, but to a large extent they are hidden in plain sight... a book might change that, even if it's buried somewhere on the internet. I have to imagine they will feel exposed in a profound way. 

It seems unlikely that anything would happen but the possibility exists that this could all go very badly for me. I'm debating on whether or not to write any of this but it's the only story I know.

Beyond all that, I'll be exposing quite a lot of people in one way or another. Most of them don't deserve to have parts of their lives on display. I'm not really concerned about my image... but this is all quite a pickle.

I won't go into detail but there were at least three subplots that were left to the imagination. There's no chance of a sequel either, so no hope to tie those loose ends up later.  
Going through Goodreads, the majority of the ratings (from all the stars) agreed that it was a good story, but hated that the subplots weren't tied off properly.  The one stars said that they hated wasting energy and sympathy on the subplots, whilst the four stars said that was the reason they didn't give a 5 star rating.

I like it when subplots tie up neatly and tight, because it satisfies me. But recently, I've been toying with eluding to an important character's mother in my story, but I want to leave it up to the imagination as to what happens with her. She never shows up in the story but gets mentioned a lot of times. A sort of red herring like the book I read.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on a scale of 1 - 10, how important do you think all subplots should be tied. One being, as long as the main plot is over, I'm fine with it. And 10 being a tight book, nothing left to wonder about later on."

I am putting together a story, I don't want to go into details on the plot, because it's not really relevant. The important thing is the dynamic between the three main characters.

You have the main main character, who is a very VERY introverted boy with an almost comical lack of social skills. The story will involve history, of which he neither knows nor cares. He has a grand destiny in front of him for which he is woefully unprepared.

The second main character is his only friend, who is a history nerd and his only real friend. He is smart and knowledgeable in all the ways the main character is not. But he is also a bit of an outcast, though he can talk to strangers where the main character would become a stammering mess.

And finally, at the beginning of the journey, the main character acquires a 'spirit guide' who will be essential for the main plot. My question is then what sort of personality I should give this spirit to mesh with the other two well. The idea being that he's an outsider at first and the main hero does not really think he's real until they get to know each other. My initial idea was that he was aggressive and crude, but that fell flat rather quickly. So the other idea is that he is not knowledgeable, but he has something the other two do not. CONFIDENCE! He can't talk to others given the whole 'linked spirit' thing, but he will try to teach the main character to be more sure of himself over time. I'm just not sure what to do currently, which means my writing has come to a screeching halt. I hope that's enough information. If not I will try to elaborate!

I went to the paragliding club and was ready for takeoff, although I had to wait for 9 hours before my turn would arrive, so I sat there on the squeaky, old, unfurnished, but comfortable chairs, covered in red leather. I could feel the adrenaline rushing through my body as I put on my equipment, more excited than I had ever been. 

As soon as I took off, I felt a strange sensation that I hadn't felt in years. I had taken off to about five hundred meters above ground, and all that was visible to me was the beautiful clouds and the evergreen forests of Brazil, and all that I could hear was the loud noise of my paragliding equipment. I wanted to experience the beauty of nature in Brazil so I decided to descend a little bit, by pressing the brown, rusty button on my paraglider.

What I saw was truly breathtaking and one of a lifetime sceneries, the aquarium-blue sea along with the bright yellow sun slowly but surely drowning into the horizon, with clouds amaranth pink and white above it. As I turned to my left, I saw a hill, with greenery covering every edge of it, and cows munching on the grass while watching the perplexing view. I could get a whiff of the grass, and hear the cows moo-ing from up there. 

As I progressed through my journey, as if the ride wasn't good enough, I saw an immense waterfall and noticed the water drizzling onto the rocks, tumbling down the enormous mountain, making a soft sound, and foaming at the bottom, as the flowers and trees close to it gently nodded. As I got too close to the waterfall, I started shivering and goosebumps had emerged on my skin. I got past the waterfall pretty quickly and then emerged at the end of my beautiful journey through the scenery in Brazil. I descended into the landing area that had been allocated for me and pulled the all-black, triangular handles on my paraglider, and stopped the ride."

I'm writing in a dead fandom, only seem to have one reader at a time, and pretty much admitted from the beginning that I was just along for the ride, so the easy answer is to just write a note to anyone who finds it that after almost two years of writing, it collapsed under its own weight.

The stuff I've been working on for the last year was an elves, humans, Cardassians set-up.  Current problem, a sorcerer who intuitively understands complex clockwork hasn't gotten a good explanation of what a computer is from people who aren't like me and don't consider complex math to be terrifying Juju.  That's what happens when you just slap things on as-needed instead of doing basic worldbuilding.  When I say worldbuilding, I really mean ""this is what each of a dozen characters understands about how the world works... and they had a decade off-screen to have conversations about it that eliminate all the cluelessness that makes dialogue-exposition possible.""

Seriously, I read in a webcomic about Jrpgs that at least one character had to be absolutely clueless about everything to have dialogue exposition."

I wrote the original story and finished it when I was a kid but while writing what would be next I began to hate how amateur my writing style was in places and knew I could tell the story better so I tried rewriting it then started something else and then I repeated the cycle again.

I remember vaguely some of the isms I learned about in literature class, but those were all about the themes of books and what they were about, rather than how the actual words and sentences are put together. 

I'm a composer and in music we have a pretty clear history of isms, and a lot of them (especially after things went fucky after 1900) are about the actual texture of the piece, how the notes are arranged, so you can immediately hear what ism the piece is part of even if you don't know what the piece is about.

For example, I'm a minimalist, and if you know what minimalist music sounds like you could immediately pick up in my pieces that it's minimalist, even though they aren't about anything.

* Finished my first draft
* Read my first draft
* Realized my novel required big picture changes (for example, my MCs parents went from being married to divorced, and I decided to change from first to third person, among other things)
* Made an outline detailing every chapter of my second draft in great detail
* Started working on my second draft
* Noticed something wasn't working, but couldn't figure out what
* Went to the park with my dog, sat down in the shade of a tree, the amber sun setting behind my back, and read all 4 chapters of my second draft
* Realized what was eating away at me so badly and made notes about what I need to change

Now that you're all caught up, my question is: Should I go back to the drawing board, re-outline, and restart? Or should I carry on to the end and keep the notes I made for when I go through my next round of revisions? 

The notes I made were pretty big changes, but also not too difficult to implement (I hope), such as realizing I started with the inciting incident and then slowed the pace down *way* too much by essentially jumping back to expository/character developmental scenes, which bored the shit out of me (a bad sign, I've heard) and messed with my expectations of pacing and flow. It should be as simple as moving chapters around and reworking the following scenes for continuity, but I'm wondering if I'm not too far in to just restart and get it over with since I know what I want? Or would that be a waste of time, since I'm no doubt going to run into more problems down the line which, if I keep up this trend of restarting every time I realize I have an issue, will inhibit be from ever completing another draft in my life.

Anyone ever been in a similar situation? If so, did you trudge through to the end and trust your future self to fix it, or did you start from scratch and get the fixing over with?

'How long has she been here?' Adam asked once he had noted all that he could... they were standing in a closed alley between an old bar and a boarded-up meat shop while being looked at by an ever-increasing crowd, trying to take a glimpse of what was going on in there…

'I have no idea...' said the barman standing behind him, 'I reported the moment I saw her... I thought she had fainted so I checked her breathing but-'

'So, you didn't see anyone or anything notable last night?' Adam asked Mr. Caleb Collins hoping for some clue at least...

'I don't know...' said he... wiping the sweat off his face, 'It sounded like the usual traffic at first but when it got closer, the carriage I mean, I thought it was just some customer looking for a drink but I had closed the bar early because of the rain… I thought no one would come but they didn’t even knock so I thought they had gone away or something… '

'Can you tell the exact time it happened?'

'Around eleven or twelve I think... ' said he once giving it a thought... 'and I did hear some movements but I thought it was just rain or something...'

'What kind of sound was it?’

‘Like a number of footsteps… but I could be wrong’

‘Hmm...' Adam said, who wanted something more concrete than this... 'and what about the girl... have you see her before?'

'No...' said the barman... 'I would have recognized her if I did... but barely anyone comes here anymore...'

'well not after this...' he said, knowing the human nature... they'll be here if only to talk about their own theories regarding the body... it is going to be quite busy... 'so tell me if you find anyone suspicious… someone asking too many questions… ' he said once he had written the barman’s statement, 'I think it'll be better if you let us do our work from here now...'

'Yes, Of course...' said Mr. Collins, before giving a last look at the body, ‘I’ll be away now…’ and then turned and went towards the back door of his old bar...

*There has to be something here*... Adam thought as he looked around... but other than some overflowing dustbins, their own footsteps, and that god awful smell... there wasn't anything much significant he could note... except for the footprints... but only if he could separate them from Mr. Collins... which would be easier if they can photograph the place well... hence looking back he searched for his Sergeant who was supposed to have brought the professional with him...

But other than the usual crowd he couldn't locate him anywhere... *where are you*? He thought as he waited... then decided to go and ask one of the constables to look for them before he finally saw him enter the fray... he looked redder than usual as he struggled through the crowd with a cameraman in tow...

'Took you long enough...' Adam said once he came near enough...

'Someone wanted to make more of the situation' he said looking dagger at the cameraman who just smiled as though he had no shame.

'Well... we got to eat too you know...?' said Roger Bates as was written on his name tag before he began to set up his camera... 'and besides the more people know the better, right?'

'Hmm...' Adam said, who didn't want any delays... they had dallied long enough 'start here if you please...'

'Wanted to make off those reporters...' said Barry jerking his chin towards the still struggling crowd... 'so... what did you find out?' he asked.

'Nothing much...' he said as they saw the cameraman do his work... 'got some footprints...' he said pointing around the body...

'And the barman?' asked Barry nodding towards the pub... 'you think he got anything to do with it?'

'I don't think so...' said Adam, as a flash lit up the alleyway, 'I don't think he would dump a body this near... not unless he *wanted* to be caught... no, it was someone else... more than one at least...'

'You don't think it has anything to do with... him?' he jerked his head as he said, Adam knew who he was talking about... 'd'you think he is at it again?'

Adam shook his head knowing it would’ve been asked eventually, 'I don’t think so... ' he said for he had seen the Ripper's work, 'not his style...’ he said… ‘we wouldn't have recognized her if that was the case, no, it was someone else... a gang perhaps... maybe they poisoned and threw her here... maybe they wanted some attention... or they could've just thrown her in the river like usual.'

'You think she's another prostitute?' asked Barry...

'Maybe...' said Adam, after giving it some thought, 'but if not, I think this is going to be much more complicated than we are hoping for...'

'Would you like to be in the frame? ' asked the cameraman once he was done taking pictures, 'would be quite good for your career...'

'No thanks...' Adam said, knowing it wouldn't be the case, not if he fails... 'I can do away with that...' then he turned to Barry who seemed eager... 'can you show him out, sergeant?' making him focus back on his work, 'And please tell the attendants to come and collect the body... it has been quite long already...' he said looking at the still increasing crowd...

'Yes... of course...' Barry said, then turning to the cameraman, he asked, 'let's go Mr. Cribbs... let me make you meet your friends, shall we?'

Adam watched them leave before they disappeared among the crowd... soon he saw a pair of morgue workers enter the alleyway... wearing white dresses and mask on face, they held a foldable stretcher between them... knowing she was about to be carried out, the crowd had gone silent... Adam saw as they opened the stretcher beside the body then grabbing hold of her by the shoulders and feet along with the blanket, lifting her off the ground before putting her on the stretcher while trying not to slip on the mud... the hardest part done, they raised her off the ground and carried her out towards the carriage waiting by the mouth of the alley... the crowd watched in silence as it got past them and was put into the morgue carriage... its doors closed shut.

Adam placed the notebook back in his pocket before he watched the crowd start its murmuring… This is going to be difficult... he thought as he went towards the backdoor of the bar and looked at the place the body had laid not a minute ago... this is going to be really difficult... he thought as he looked at all of their footprints, overflowing garbage and no sign of blood anywhere...

'Mr. Grant?' Adam called before the door closed behind him, 'we are done for the time...' he said, but stopped when he saw a glass of golden liquid beside the barman, trying to ignore it he said, 'but... if there is something you wanted to tell us... 'now will be a good time...'

The barman thought for a second before he shook his head, 'No... I think I have told you everything worth mentioning but if I remember something, I surely will tell you...' he looked out of the door then which was crowded with people trying to look in, 'this is going to be quite a talk in the town isn't?'

'It looks like it...' Adam said as they both stared at the brewing storm outside... 'well... I suppose I should get going now... at least you wouldn't have any lack of customers now, would you?'

'It looks like it...' he said before he took one small gulp out of his glass... 'oh I almost forget...' he said as he stood up from his chair... 'would you like a glass of beer too detective?'

'Oh no...' said Adam with an involuntary smile, 'there is work to do...' he said adjusting his fedora, 'sometime later perhaps...' then clearing his throat he said, 'well... I will see you later then...’ and finally went towards the front where he stood for a moment before turning the knob and getting out into the open-

'Is this another Ripper attack detective?' they asked him, 'will this be another unsolved case, detective?... 'you think the police is doing enough work?', 'is there going to be another attack?' and so on... but knowing he won't be quoted right and with a lot of research still to be done he kept his mouth shut and somehow managed to come out of the thickest of the mass before crossing the street… Barry was waiting with an open door to the carriage they had come in…

'I hope it won't get worse than this...' Barry asked once they had closed the doors and watched many of them still struggling around... before the constables came to clear the space for the carriage to move...

'It's just the start sergeant' Adam said who knew the whole circus of it, 'let's just hope we got over it sooner...'

'Yeah...' Barry said, still looking at the dispersing crowd while Adam had taken a more resting position... 'let's hope so...'

They waited in silence as they went through the yet empty streets which soon will be filled up by many a carriages, trams and god knows what… it was because of this they reached their destination sooner than usual... the morgue vehicle was ahead of them, yet they weren't that far apart in their arrival... and nor were some of the reporter's carriages who were following right behind...

The Carriages stopped by the black gates of the morgue which were made open by the attendants who got off their vehicles and started to lift the body off the carriage and into the building...He too got off the vehicle as the attendants carried the body by the gates and into the courtyard... while Adam went towards the gatekeeper and told him not to let the reporters enter inside... but when he saw the constables arriving behind the reporter’s carriages he knew it won't be much of a problem now...

The Inside of the morgue was as clear as you could ask for, lit by the modern gaslights it was managed by the nurses, doctors, and staff in their cream-white dresses, even if the building was covered in soot from the chimney smoke nearby... they went by two empty corridors before they stopped at the second door on the right...

'Where is Dr. Fredrickson?' He asked the assistants once they had put the body on one of the slabs, 'can you ask him to come as soon as possible…?’

'He is here...' Barry said before he was even replied with a nod... and surely there was Dr. Matthew Fredrickson, looking as energetic as ever with his thick glasses, a dark moustache, and a bald head... he looked as prepared as he always had and shook Adam's hand...

'What have you brought me this time, eh detective?' he asked already looking beyond him... 'Where did you find that one?'

'One of the alleys as usual...' he said, as the doctor moved towards the body and removed the blanket...

'She is young...' he said, 'around 16 I think...' he removed the blanket further... 'no wounds or anything... she wasn't murdered or anything was she?'

'Well, that's the thing to find out...'

'Hmm...' he said now looking more closely at the midriff... 'you don't think she was pregnant?' he said pointing at some very faint stretch lines on her stomach... 'with this belly fat... she sure looks like it... you think she lost her blood in childbirth or something?'

Bile came to his throat before he could say anything and hence jumped for the dustbin where he vomited everything, he had eaten that day...

Alarmed, the doctor asked, 'You alright detective? should I call a nurse?'

Adam lifted his hand in denial before vomiting some more, they waited until he was able to speak, 'No...' Adam said in his hoarse voice while still waiting if it was finished... but after giving several dry heaves he was done... 'water...' he said to both of the men who stood worried behind him...

'I'll get it from my office, wait here...' the doctor said as he hurried past Adam and into the corridor.

'You alright sir?' Barry asked, looking concerned.

He sighed, 'It's nothing...' he said 'must have eaten something bad...'

'We can get some medicine if you want...' suggested Barry as the doctor came back with a glass of water...

Adam went to a washbasin where he cleaned his mouth before taking some more gulps before giving it back...

'Let's just finish here first, shall we?' Adam said once he dried his face with his handkerchief, trying hard to look casual, and not look at the girl's body, he said, 'you're sure that's the cause of her dying?'

'Perhaps...' said the doctor still looking concerned, 'it could be some kind of disease we don't know anything about... but for now, I think that’s the case’

'when can you tell for sure?'

'A day, I think...'

'Alright...' said Adam, 'I’ll send someone to collect the report tomorrow… I think we are done here for now then?’

‘I think so…’ said the doctor… ‘if you don’t need anything else…’

‘No, I think we are done here…’ he said now holding his hand to the doctor who shook it after a moment’s hesitation…

‘You sure you are alright detective?’ he asked again…

‘I’m alright…’ he said lightly, ‘and don’t get all worried for me… that’s my wife job, not yours…’ then he turned to Barry… ‘let’s go, shall we?’

‘Yeah…’ Barry said who gave a glance to the doctor before saying, ‘let’s go…’

'well then, I'll meet you later...' he said as he shook the doctor's hand once again and left the room...

Once they had gone far enough, Barry asked, 'Are you really alright sir? I can take you home if you'd like...'

'I am fine Barry... but I do need some time...' said he, thinking fast of an excuse, 'I don't do well in morgues if you know what I mean...' he smiled shamefully... 'well... I hope you will manage at the office... tell them I wasn’t feeling good, I don’t think they would mind... we have already done whatever we could so…'

'And what do we tell the press?'

'Nothing...' he said, 'not yet at least... we still have a lot to find out, we’ll just tell them we're still working on it... I don't think they can make anything bad out of it...'

Barry still looked a little apprehensive, yet he said, 'Okay... so where do we go from here?’ he said looking at the reporters outside now being blocked by too many constables around the main gate…

‘This way I suppose…’ he said nodding towards the back door, ‘I hope there is no one there…’

But there was someone there, along with a guard, he could see another constable through the bars ‘Hey, John…’ he said once he had recognized who it was… ‘how’s it going?’

‘it’s alright sir…’ he said, ‘you going somewhere?’

‘Yeah…’ he said as the door was opened for him, ‘but I wouldn’t be far… Barry here is going to the office so tell him if you need something…’

‘We shall do that…’ said the constable who was looking at him with narrow eyes… ‘see you later then…’

Adam nodded at him, shook hands with Barry and went away… This talk with the constable bothered him a bit the way he was looking at him… did he knew where he would be going? It wasn’t a secret regarding his drinking habit… but to feel it at first hand was a different story altogether…

Still keeping a low profile, he went through several narrow alleyways until he found an empty carriage on one of the busy streets... he hopped inside once telling his destination and telling the driver not to disturb him while they were on their way... the driver naturally agreed to it when presented with the money beforehand and made his mule finally move into motion...

He wasn't happy going there... but what other choice did he have? He should've taken that drink after all..."
