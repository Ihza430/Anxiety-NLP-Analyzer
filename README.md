## Problem Statement
About 19% of adults have an anxiety disorder (Anxiety disorders, 2017). To put this in perspective that is over 40 million people in the US with anxiety. Now one’s choice of words even punctuation can hint at the mental or emotional status of a person (Havigerová et al., 2019). There are systems already created for the purpose of analyzing text to provide feedback about a person like the system, TensiStrength (Thelwall, 2016). The goal is to create a similar system with posts from the anxiety subreddit and classify them into varying degrees of anxiety. The three classes will be not anxious, moderate anxiety, and severe anxiety. To classify we will be creating a custom sentiment analysis based on the results from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multinomial Bayes. Our metrics will be accuracy and specificity. The deliverable is to create a streamlit app to provide a message based on the classification of anxiety from their input text.
